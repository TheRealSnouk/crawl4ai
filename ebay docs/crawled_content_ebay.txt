Get started with eBay APIs
Overview
eBay APIs (Application Programming Interface) are the front door to our global marketplace platform. They enable our business to expand into new contexts and allow third-party
platforms to extend their value proposition. For over 20 years, the
eBay Developers Program
has provided our developers with capabilities at scale, and in turn they invent and create fantastic buying and selling experiences for their users.
With the eBay Developers Program, you can use program resources to build and offer any of the following tools or services:
Selling—create listings, manage inventory, and post-order activities
Buying—discover inventory and manage checkout and bidding tasks
Searching—customized interfaces for searching the eBay marketplace
Affiliate—earn commissions by creating tools that drive traffic to eBay listings and generate sales. To learn more, see the
Affiliate Program
Customer service functionality—feedback, customer communications
Marketing—promoted listings, coupons, discounts, and item promotions
eBay Developers Program membership is free, and you can use virtually any programming language to interface with eBay APIs. We provide RESTful (REST) and SOAP-based APIs
as well as
software development kits (SDKs)
. Program in C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Visual Basic or another language, and tap into the comprehensive
technical documentation
and extensive selection of samples.

API license agreement
Your use of eBay APIs is subject to the terms in the
API License Agreement
.
Purpose
: Briefly describe what the API does and why this guide is essential.
Prerequisites
: List what is needed before getting started (e.g., developer account, API key, language, libraries, IDE).
Understand the eBay APIs
API methods generally correspond to particular individual activities that an eBay user would trigger while on an eBay site or application. Each API call has a distinct purpose and may
only be applicable at a particular point in the lifecycle of a listing, such as when the item is first listed, when a buyer is considering the purchase of a listed item, or when the seller and
buyer are completing an order.
You can select a programming language (such as PHP, .NET, Java, or any other language that you're comfortable with) to interact with eBay APIs. We also have
software developer kits (SDKs)
to make your programming tasks in these languages easier.
Through the power of eBay APIs, your application can operate independently of the eBay user interface. Your application doesn't need to change every time the eBay user interface
changes, and it doesn't need to present data in the same way that eBay does. Your eBay-enabled application can present data in custom ways that best meet your users' needs.
eBay APIs provide programmatic access to an eBay marketplace, enabling you to build custom applications, tools, and services that leverage the eBay marketplaces in new ways.
With eBay APIs, you can create applications that perform many of the operations that you can perform on the eBay site, eBay mobile application, or other eBay tools.
The eBay Developers Program offers the following APIs to create innovative solutions that tap into the power of eBay:
Sell APIs
—Create end-to-end selling applications to help professional sellers with their selling activity on eBay. From configuring account settings and listing inventory on eBay to marketing
listings and reporting on seller performance, the selling APIs help you create applications that enable sellers to scale their businesses on eBay. These APIs also cover core
capabilities related to general commerce activities, such as identifying appropriate eBay categories, searching for products in the eBay catalog, and retrieving user account profile
information.
Note:
Traditional APIs
—If a function you want to use isn't available in the RESTful APIs above, explore the capabilities in these Traditional SOAP-based APIs. As we improve the RESTful APIs and create
new ones, we're also gradually deprecating these Traditional APIs. So consider carefully before you decide to use a Traditional API.
Buy APIs
—Use these turnkey solutions to create buying experiences in your application or website. Retrieve purchasable items, check out, then track orders without visiting the eBay site
Developer APIs
—Get insights into your API integrations
Our latest buy and sell APIs provide you with powerful technology and features that let you build applications to provide buyers and sellers with a seamless, connected experience
across their commerce workflow.
Understand eBay Marketplaces
Numerous eBay marketplaces exist around the globe. If you want your application to interface with multiple eBay marketplaces, it's important to understand how these marketplaces
work.
Sellers can list the same item on multiple marketplaces to make the item available to a broader audience. In some cases, eBay will automatically expose the same listing on multiple
marketplaces as long as the seller is willing to ship to the country of that marketplace.
Learn more about selling internationally
.
From a buyer's point-of-view, most of the listings that the buyer sees will probably be listings that were created on that marketplace. They could see listings created on another
marketplace because eBay is surfacing those listings on the buyer's marketplace.
For prices/currencies, eBay converts to the currency of the marketplace where the buyer is viewing the listing. For example, if a buyer is viewing an item that an eBay US seller listed
on the UK marketplace, that buyer sees prices converted to British pounds even though the seller listed the item in US dollars. This currency conversion is done automatically by
eBay and isn't something the seller or your application needs to do.
Common differences between marketplaces are the inventory available and the currencies and languages used. All API schema elements are in English, but the values of some fields
are returned in the native language used by the eBay marketplace's country. In some cases, you can use language-related headers to localize some field values into the specified
language.
eBay uses predefined site identifiers for each eBay marketplace. You may need to enter a site identifier to specify the eBay marketplace you're working with. Depending on the API
call, these IDs may be passed through an HTTP header, through a path or query parameter, or through the request payload.
For a full list of site IDs, see:
Marketplace ID values
for RESTful APIs
SiteCodeType
for Traditional SOAP/XML APIs
To learn more about how to use these IDs to set the eBay marketplace, see:
HTTP request headers
for RESTful APIs
Specify the target site
for Traditional SOAP/XML APIs
Understand the Sandbox and Production environments
As a member of the eBay Developers Program, you'll work in two environments:
Sandbox
A self-contained virtual testing environment that allows you to test your application without impacting real eBay users, real eBay listings, or real money.
As you develop your application, you'll need to
test its functionality
in the Sandbox by simulating the various tasks related to buying and selling on eBay before you transact in the Production environment. Items listed and sold in the Sandbox aren't
real transactions, and all listing fees and item purchases are paid with fictional money.
Production
The live environment where an eBay-enabled application sends real data to the eBay marketplace with real eBay users, listings, and transactions. An eBay user who views the eBay
marketplace through a browser or the eBay mobile application is viewing data in the Production environment. Your application will run in this environment after you go live.
Sandbox benefits
Testing in the Sandbox has the following benefits:
Fully test and debug your eBay API routines before you run them in Production. Make calls to experiment with function calls, prototype new routines, and test your application's
business logic.
Important!
Don't use the Sandbox for testing eBay service performance or load handling—high call volumes may result in an interruption of service for your account.
Test buying, selling, and after-sale workflows without using real money.
List and relist items without having to pay real fees to eBay and without any obligation to deliver real items to real buyers.
Watch how mock eBay transactions generated by your requests to the eBay APIs are processed, without touching any live eBay listings, user accounts, or bank accounts.
We recommend using Production to test searching capabilities and metadata calls.
Understand user accounts
This table outlines the differences between the following accounts. These accounts are independent and not interoperable across sites.

Understand application keysets
eBay uses unique identifiers called “application keysets” that tell eBay which application is making a call. An application keyset serves as your application's credentials and is required
for making API calls.
Application ID/client ID
—Uniquely identifies your application; can't be changed
Dev ID
—Uniquely identifies your developer profile; can't be changed
Cert ID/secret
—A client secret, like a password for this keyset, that should be kept confidential;
can be reset
You can create a separate keyset for the
Sandbox and Production environments
.
Tip:
Just as you would store and protect passwords, use the same caution in storing and using your application keyset. For example, if authorization strings are hard-coded in a compiled
application, an unethical individual could see the IDs by inspecting or reverse engineering. We highly recommend using strong encryption of the IDs in your application to prevent
credential theft.
Resetting your cert ID
Your application cert ID is like a password for your keyset. If you think your keyset has been compromised, you can change your cert ID at any time. Creating a new cert ID doesn't
affect existing user tokens that have already been created for your application.
Once you generate a new cert ID, your old cert ID expires at the end of the grace period that you specify.
The grace period can be a value between 0 (expires immediately) and 4000 days. Use 4000 if your company's security standard is to always have two cert IDs available, so that you
can switch between them as needed without signing in to the eBay Developers portal.
A typical grace period is between 30 and 90 days. During the grace period, both cert IDs are valid, so that you can deploy your application changes and revoke older tokens as
needed.
You can't use the new cert ID to revoke user tokens that you created with the old ID. If you plan to revoke older tokens, make sure you do so before the old cert ID expires.
Use Case Description
: Explain the specific use case this guide addresses (e.g., integrating payment systems, fetching product data, etc.).
Why This Use Case?
: Briefly explain the importance and benefits of this particular use case.
Create the eBay API keysets and create Sandbox users
To use the eBay APIs, you need to
create a keyset
. To test run your application's features and functionality,
Create a Sandbox user
.
Create the eBay API keysets
For your application to run in the Sandbox or Production environment, it needs to have the appropriate keyset for that environment.
Sign in to your
eBay Developer Program
account.
Go to the
Application Keys
page.
Enter your application name. Under either Sandbox or Production, select
Create a keyset
.
Note:
If you have already created an application, you can view it when you login. If you have previously created a keyset for either Sandbox or Production, you have the option to generate
a new keyset for the other environment by selecting
Create a keyset
.
Important!
Before you can use your Production keyset, you must subscribe to or opt out of
eBay marketplace account deletion/closure notifications
. If you see the “Your Keyset is currently disabled” message, select the link in the message to begin the compliance process.
Your keyset appears on the
Application Keys
page and on your
My Account
dashboard.
Each application keyset is assigned a set of scopes, where each scope gives the application access to different API methods, resources, and functionality.
Use
Request another keyset
to request an additional keyset for another application. When you request another keyset, you're asking for an additional keyset for a different application, not a replacement keyset
for an application that already has one.
Create a Sandbox user
Before you start running your application in Production, we recommend that you fully test your application's features and functionality in the Sandbox to make sure your application
operates as intended and without error.
Sandbox test users are virtual eBay accounts that exist only in the Sandbox environment. These accounts represent the users who perform the mock transactions you create as you
test your application.
To create an eBay test user account:
Sign in to your
eBay Developer Program
account.
From any eBay developers page, select
Develop
Tools
eBay Sandbox
Create Test Users
.
On the
Register for Sandbox
page, complete the form.
The following table talks more about the constraints and requirements of each field that must be provided in the form:
Field
Description
Username
Every Sandbox username is prefixed with
TESTUSER_
. You can't change this. Enter the rest of the username.
Tip: Create usernames that help you remember the role that the user will play in your mock transactions. For example,
TESTUSER_buyer-Bob
or
TESTUSER_Sam-seller
can help you keep track of who is signed into the Sandbox and what actions that user should complete during a test.
Email
A unique email address is required for each test user. If the email is already being used by another test user, registration will fail.
Password
Enter a password. Use between 8 and 64 characters, include at least one letter, at least one number, and at least one of these supported symbols:
! @ # $ % ^ * - _ + =
First Name
Last Name
The user's name can be fictitious.
Feedback score
Registration date
Registration site
If needed, change the default values. For help on these fields, select the information icon next to the field.
The
Registration site
value should be consistent with the eBay site where you're going to test, but you may want to experiment with test users from other countries if you want to test cross-border trade
and/or international shipping.
Read the User Agreement and API License Agreement, then select
Register
.
Repeat this process to create more Sandbox test users, saving each username and password in a place where you can access them as needed.
Tips on working with test users
The number of test users you need to create depends on the workflows you plan to test in your application. Because transactions have both buyers and sellers, you should create at
least one seller and one buyer to test most flows. You need both because eBay doesn't allow a seller to purchase or bid on their own listing, a rule that also applies in the Sandbox.
If you're going to test multiple-quantity, fixed-price listings or auction listings and competitive bidding between multiple buyers, create at least one seller and at least two buyers.
Even if your application only supplies functionality that serves sellers, such as only listing items with no bidding or purchasing, you should also test the effects of buyer actions to
make sure that your application handles all of the interactions it may encounter when in Production. We recommend testing your application for typical scenarios including:
Users placing bids
Users winning auctions
Calculating shipping costs
Handling non-paying bidders
Creating orders
Find the right API for your use case
Maybe you already have in mind a specific business need for your application. Or maybe you're looking to break into eCommerce application development without a specific type of
application in mind. Before you begin application development, it's a good idea to explore the available eBay APIs, including their associated guides and reference docs, to gain a
clearer understanding of the features available to you.
Sell inventory on eBay—Sell APIs
Allow users to buy eBay items without leaving your website—Buy APIs
Important!
The Buy APIs listed here are intended for certain approved eBay partners based on their application. See
Get Started in a Buying Application
to learn more about the application process. Acceptance of applications is based on the proposed business model, as well as a formal agreement to abide by the policies and
requirements stipulated by eBay.
Use the API Explorer to try out APIs
API Explorer is a tool that lets you run sample calls for most eBay API methods in the Sandbox and Production environments.
You must be signed in to your developer account to use API Explorer.
Complete this process to run a sample call.
Step 1: Access API Explorer and select the method you want to test
Sign into your eBay Developers account.
Go to
API Explorer
.
At the left side of the API Explorer, select the following:
The Environment where you want to run the call. The
application keyset
for that environment displays in the box under Environment. If the box is blank, you need to create a keyset for the selected environment (
Sandbox
or
Production
) before you can use API Explorer.
Important!
If a user access token (not an application access token) is going to be used with the call, make sure to use the link to generate the user access token. This will make the eBay user
(for whom the call is being made) go through the consent flow.
The
Site ID
(marketplace) you want to target. This sets this value in the X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID header (RESTful) or X-EBAY-API-SITEID header (Trading). For example, if you select
(101) Italy, you get
X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID:EBAY_IT
as the header value.
Important!
Some APIs and methods are restricted to specific users and/or specific marketplaces. For more details on restrictions for each API, see that API Overview page for that API.
The API you want to use. To learn more about the selected API, select
API Documentation
.
The API call you want to test. To learn more about the selected call, select
API Call Documentation
.
Step 2: Authorize calls
Like all calls made to eBay APIs, the calls you make through API Explorer must be authorized.
Nearly all methods work with OAuth access tokens, which is the recommended
type of authorization
. Auth'n'Auth access tokens are still available for Traditional APIs.
The type of OAuth access token you need depends on the API call you select. A user access token is needed when the operation being performed requires the identity of the eBay
user. Either way, all access tokens expire after a short period.
If you need an application access token, select
Get OAuth Application Token
. The token is generated and added to the
Token
box.
If you need a user access token:
Select
Get OAuth User Token
to go to the eBay sign-in page for the selected environment.
Complete the user consent web flow to authorize your application to act on the user's behalf.
When you get consent:
For OAuth, the user access token is added to the Token box.
For Auth'n'Auth, a new browser tab opens. Copy and paste the token value from that tab into the Token box.
Step 3: Configure the request
At the right side of the API Explorer, select
Samples
to see a list of the preconfigured samples available for the selected call and select one.
Edit the selected sample to configure any aspect of the request.
Because many of the methods in eBay APIs are sequential in nature and many of the required identifiers are personal to each eBay user, many of the preconfigured samples require
you to configure the request before you can make the call.
For example, if you're trying to get the details on a fulfillment policy with
GET /fulfillment_policy/
, you need to supply the
fulfillmentPolicyId
for your own policy that you want to inspect.
Review the endpoint for the selected sample and make sure you have supplied valid values for any placeholders, such as curly braces ( ) or angle brackets ( < > ), in the URL.
If the method you're calling uses query parameters, set and customize these query parameters based on what you want to test. Multiple samples are often provided for methods with
query parameters, and these samples demonstrate the proper syntax to use when using these parameters.
If your method employs a request body, replace any variables in the sample request with valid values. Variable placeholders are often signified as variable names placed within curly
braces ( ) or angle brackets ( < > ). Replace the entire string, brackets and braces included, with the values you want to use for your test call.
Step 4: Make a request
Check that the following request parameters and payload are set correctly:
Token
URI
Request payload (if applicable)
HTTP headers
Select
Execute
.
If the request is successful, the Call Response section shows the expected response payload in JSON (RESTful APIs) or XML (Traditional APIs) format.
If the request is unsuccessful or only partially successful, an errors array (for RESTful APIs) or an errors container (for Traditional API APIs) is included that identifies one or more
issues with the request. Note that some methods only return an HTTP status code and have no response payload associated with them.

Use eBay OpenAPI specs, SDKs, widgets, and WSDLs
eBay OpenAPI specifications
OpenAPI Specification
(OAS) is available for all of our RESTful public APIs. You can download OpenAPI contract for eBay APIs, generate clients in one of 40+ supported programming languages, and
successfully invoke an eBay API in minutes. For more information and a video to see a demonstration of how OpenAPI-based contracts can speed up API integrations, see
/news/openapi-coverage
.
eBay SDKs, widgets, and WSDLs
Explore our
SDKs
,
widgets
, and
WSDLs
to learn how to make your application development easier.
SDKs for eBay APIs
SDKs (software development kits) are designed to make application development easier and more efficient. SDKs are downloadable kits that include precoded solutions for common
programming tasks in a language you already use.
SDKs help simplify some common programming tasks, such as error handling and call retry. Learn more about
all eBay SDKs
.
Customizable widgets
eBay widgets are customizable, reusable components powered by eBay APIs that make it easier for you to add certain functions to your application.
Learn more about eBay widgets
.
WSDL to create client stub
Just like every RESTful API has OAS contracts available for download, every traditional API has an XML-based WSDL available that will help a user get up and running making API
calls. The location of the WSDLs for each API can be found on the "Making a Call" page of that API's documentation set. For the Trading API,
Select this link
to download the latest WSDL.

Secure your application
When developing an application, you need to be security-aware. Applications often request, reference, or otherwise use data such as:
Credit card or other payment credentials and information
User's personal identifying information, such as names, addresses (email and physical), phone numbers, and so on
Application credentials and tokens
Business intelligence data, such as order sizes, sales data, and other information that has the potential to be misused by competitors and other businesses
As an application developer, you're responsible for securing your users' data and accounts. You're expected to follow the
OWASP secure coding principles
(or
OWASP Cheat Sheet
) and address the
OWASP Top 10 Most Critical Web Application Security Risks
.
The subsections below describe the eBay-specific actions that are either expected of you and your application or are generally good security practices to follow.
Credentials and token management
You are expected to use the eBay-provided secured and authenticated services to perform user authentication with eBay.
Encourage users to reset their passwords if they suspect their sign-in credentials are compromised.
Periodically
reset your cert ids (client secrets)
and if there is a cert ID breach, ask eBay Developer Technical Support to revoke any active tokens. Active tokens can exist for a considerable post-reset period.
Never send cert IDs via email to anyone including eBay employees.
Authentication and authorization
Force a complex password policy and use anti-automation to avoid credential stuffing attacks.
Usage of strong authentication mechanisms involving 2FA / MFA are recommended.
Require input validation on both the client and server side of your application.
Use role-based authorization with least privileges as default.
Session management
Invalidate any session identifiers after a successful logout or timeout on both the server and client sides.
Always assign a new session ID after a successful authentication.
For cookie-based sessions, ensure no sensitive information is added to the cookie. Instead, always use a random session ID and ensure proper cookie security is followed.
Data protection
Encrypt or hash all sensitive data in transit or at rest.
Ensure you use NIST-recommended strong cryptographic algorithms.
Communication and HTTPS
Always send data via HTTPS, especially PCI data.
Perform all sensitive data read/writes over HTTPS.
Don't use a weak SSL implementation. Use strong configuration with the latest protocols, ciphers, and certificates.
Remove all sensitive data from GET requests. Use other HTTP methods for update/delete operations.
Maintain strict HTTPS hygiene by using the HSTS security header.
Security best practices
Perform regular security assessments of your application and fix all security issues.
Ensure rate limiting of sensitive and highly used front end pages to prevent volumetric attacks.
Ensure all user input is validated and output is properly encoded based on context.
Ensure servers don't disclose information technology used or version information.
Errors, stack traces, and debug information must not be displayed to the user on the web page.
Ensure no sensitive information is logged into Application and System logs.
Best Practices
As you develop your application, it's a good idea to follow these practices:
Use existing valid access tokens instead of creating new tokens.
Use the modern and RESTful APIs when developing your application. Some benefits include:
HTTP is widely used, so sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses doesn't require much bandwidth.
JSON and URL addressing protocols are used, which minimizes the work needed to get your application up and running since all APIs of this type have the same easy-to-learn
interface format.
To make efficient use of your API calls, cache data locally and avoid retrieving duplicate data multiple times.
Follow the best practices (if any) that eBay defines for each call. For example:
Use calls that return more data. Some APIs include several calls that provide similar services. Using calls that return more data reduces the number of calls you need to make and
makes your application more efficient.
Use filters to retrieve incremental updates for calls that return large result sets. Certain calls, such as those related to getting category information, return large result sets. If the data
includes historical information or information that doesn't change frequently, we recommend that you store all the data initially, and then use filters to only retrieve incremental
updates.
Subscribe to order-related platform notifications to reduce the number and frequency of order retrieval calls. For example, eBay can send you a notification when a fixed-price listing
generates a sale or an auction listing ends.
Always
test your application in the Sandbox
.
As with all applications, your application should implement at least basic error handling.
Build flexibility into your application and stay up to date with API-specific release notes.
Because we support several versions of an API at any given time, you have more time to adapt to changes made to the eBay website. You don't have to upgrade each time a new
version of an API comes out, but you might be interested in new features and changes to functionality that you currently use. We also limit support for outdated functionality. Regularly
check the API release notes and
API updates
to stay current.
Understand when listing-related fees are charged.
All
seller fees
that apply when a seller lists an item through a UI, tool, or mobile application also apply when an application lists an item through an API. We recommend that you design your
application to inform users when they will be charged additional fees. If using the Trading API, consider using “verify” calls instead of add, revise, and relist item calls. Verify calls
provide the same validation but don't actually publish,update, or relist an item. So they return the same errors or warnings and also show the applicable fees that will be charged to
the seller if the listing is published, updated, or relisted.
Consider providing a
Sign-in with eBay option
to create a great user experience.
Request an application growth check
The application growth check is a free service that the eBay Developers Program provides to its members. During the application growth check process, we critically review all new
applications for compliance with the application growth check requirements, at no cost to you.
Requesting an application growth check is required if you want to:
Increase the
API call limits
for your application
Use restricted APIs in production
The following lists some helpful recommendations to review before you submit an application growth check request:
Application readiness
—You'll need a working application that we can test to ensure it complies with the requirements for the application growth check. Be sure to follow the guidelines below as you create
your application.
API license and eBay policies
—Check that your application complies with:
The
eBay API License Agreement.
This includes, but isn't limited to, how your application:
Collects statistical or other information related to specific eBay users, groups of eBay users, or types of eBay users.
Derives conversion, completion, or success rates, unless the information is specific to the user logged into your application and only to be shown to that user.
Estimates or displays reserve auction prices of other users.
Derives sales or activity rates for listings with specific features or enhancements, unless the information is specific to the listings created by the user logged into your application and
only for that user's view.
Displays a user's private profile or detailed feedback information, unless the information is specific to the user logged into your application and only to be shown to that user.
Collects statistical data about eBay.
Derives average selling price or gross merchandise value for any eBay category.
eBay site policies
Consumer protection and privacy laws
The
eBay User Agreement
The eBay
User Privacy Notice
Technical best practices—Ensure that your application:
Follows the
OWASP secure coding principles
. Learn about web application vulnerabilities and how to protect against them in the
OWASP "Top Ten".
Uses the UTF-8 encoding scheme (not ISO-8859-1). See
Working with UTF-8
in the eBay developer's knowledge base.
Uses the latest versions of the APIs. Go to
the API documentation
and view the release notes for the APIs you're using to find the latest versions. When you submit your information, you'll need to specify which version of each API your application is
using.
Handles errors gracefully and implements retries correctly. In particular, implements retries for a maximum of two times for infrastructure errors. Errors that are returned from calls
must include useful details and instructions for both end users and applications.
Limits the volume of data returned by asking only for the required amount of information and doesn't make calls more frequently than necessary. eBay reserves the right to restrict an
application's polling frequencies for any calls. This type of restriction typically occurs when eBay determines that an application is causing a negative operational impact to the eBay
site.
Doesn't collect eBay usernames and passwords from your customers. If your application uses APIs that require user authentication (some APIs don't), it must retrieve
user access tokens
: OAuth tokens for RESTful APIs and OAuth or Auth'n'Auth tokens for Traditional APIs.
Recovers gracefully when the number of items returned per page changes. Some calls return multiple items in response to a single call. eBay reserves the right to change the
maximum number of items returned per page.
If you have a web application, it doesn't put eBay web pages served by eBay servers in an iFrame.
If you have a desktop application with an embedded browser and your application displays an eBay web page served by eBay servers, your application displays the complete URL of
the page.
If you have a search application, it uses the Buy API or Finding API.

Use the
WSDL pruner tool
to prune a copy of any legacy WSDL such as Trading, Merchant Data, Shopping, and Finding to reduce the operational size of the WSDL. Essentially, the pruner tool allows you to
pick and choose which operations you want to work with. All operations/calls that are not selected and their exclusively-used types are omitted from the resultant customized WSDL.
Note:
The tool works on all major operating systems.
Ensure you have downloaded the WSDL you wish to use to your local machine.
Tip:
Each WSDL follows the same download path with the filename being the only difference. For example, the path for the Trading WSDL is
https://developer.ebay.com/webservices/latest/ebaysvc.wsdl (https://developer.ebay.com/webservices/latest/ebaysvc.wsdl)
, the Shopping WSDL is
https://developer.ebay.com/webservices/latest/shopping.wsdl (https://developer.ebay.com/webservices/latest/shopping.wsdl)
, and so forth. If you want a specific version of a WSDL, replace 'latest' in the path with the actual version number of the wsdl. For example, to download the 1225 version of Trading
WSDL, use path:
https://developer.ebay.com/webservices/1225/ebaysvc.wsdl (https://developer.ebay.com/webservices/1225/ebaysvc.wsdl)
.
Start the tool by running
java -jar pruner.jar
in the command line. In Windows, you can click
start.bat
in the root of the install directory to start the tool directly.
Click
Import Wsdl
to browse to and import an eBay Trading WSDL.
Select the operations you want to retain in the WSDL. Alternatively, you can click
Select All
to select all operations and then unselect the ones you do not want.
Click
Prune
to prune the WSDL. You'll be prompted to specify an output folder. Save the file.
Note:
There are some unreferenced (orphan) types in the eBay Trading WSDL. To include them, check
Include unreferenced types

Authorization
Overview
We support two methods for authorizing the calls you make to the eBay APIs:
OAuth—All eBay RESTful APIs use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for application and user authorization. OAuth is the industry standard for assuring your online transactions are secure. You
must provide a valid access token for each request you make to the eBay RESTful interfaces. OAuth access tokens verify to eBay that a request is coming from a valid application
and that the application has the user's authorization to carry out the requests. You can also use OAuth tokens with eBay Traditional APIs.
Important:
If you use Traditional APIs like the Trading API, we recommend that you use OAuth, but eBay's older Auth'n'Auth process is still available for older applications.
The OAuth scopes assigned to your application allow it to access specific API resources and methods. A valid OAuth token can successfully authorize a request only if the token was
generated with the scope required by the target method.
You can see the OAuth scopes for your application in
Application Keys
.
Auth’n’Auth—The authentication and authorization technology used by eBay Traditional APIs.
Working with OAuth scopes
OAuth scopes grant your application access to the different methods and resources. The OAuth tokens you use to authorize your requests must have the OAuth scope required by
the methods and resources you are trying to access.
No matter which type of OAuth access token you generate, you must supply the set of scopes for the functionality you will be accessing with the generated token.
In another way, a valid OAuth token can successfully authorize a request only if the token was generated with the scope required by the target method.

The assignment of scopes
Once signed in to the Developers Program, you can generate
application keys
for both the Sandbox and Production environments.
When generated, each set of application keys is assigned a set of
scopes
where each scope gives the application access to different API methods, resources, and functionality.
You can view the sets of scopes assigned to your application keyset through the
Application Keys
page in the developer portal
Click the
OAuth Scopes
link that is displayed in the lower-right of the image below to get the list of scopes for your application:
Scopes and access
Each scope assigned to an application keyset determines:
The set of resources that can be accessed with the scope.
The set of operations that can be performed with the scope.
The request you use to generate the new token must include a list of scopes that allows access to
all
the methods you plan to call with the token.
To discover the scopes you need for your application, refer to the
OAuth scope
section of the API documentation for each method you use in your application. Then, mint your access tokens using at least one of the scopes listed for each method you call. In this
way, each access token will contain the authorization needed to make all the requests.
Specifying scopes when minting access tokens
Whichever flow you use to generate OAuth access tokens, you must always supply a valid list of scopes with your request to generate the token.
When using the
Identity API
to mint tokens, the scopes belonging to an application keyset are passed in through a scope query parameters. See
The client credentials grant flow
and
The authorization code grant flow
for detailed information on how to pass in the scopes through the scopes query parameter.
Getting the list of scopes assigned to your application
When you create a set of application keys, a set of scopes is assigned to your application keyset.
The Developers Program offers a sample request for both the Sandbox and Production environments and you can use these samples to get a string of the scopes that have been
assigned to your application.
To get the list of scopes assigned to your application keyset for either the Sandbox of Production environment:
Log in to the eBay Developer Program and navigate to
Your Account > Application Keys
.
Click the
User Tokens
link that's displayed next to the Client ID of the environment you want to target:
This displays the User Tokens (eBay Sign-In) page.
Under the
Get a Token from eBay via Your Application
heading, after configuring an RuName, an
RuName
box similar to the following displays:
To view a complete sample request, click the
See all
link.
Copy from the sample the full value of the
scope
parameter to get a list of scopes assigned to your application.
URL-encode the
scope
value when you send it with your request to the token server.
When you copy the scopes in this manner, you can end up using a larger set of scopes than is needed by your application. The user scopes imply a permission grant, and users must
consent
to all the permissions your scopes represent before they can use your application.
Be aware, it's possible the Sandbox and Production environments support different sets of scopes for your application. When supplying the string of scopes in your token requests, be
sure to match the scopes to the environment you're targeting.
Scopes and grant flows
The eBay token service mints access tokens via two different grant flows:
Client credentials grant flow mints a new Application access token.
Authorization code grant flow mints a new User access token.
Each flow uses a different process to generate access tokens and the grant flow you use depends upon the "scopes" assigned to the eBay methods used in your application.
The client credentials grant flow
is used to mint application tokens, which can be used if the application is accessing or working with resources and data that is not specific to an eBay user. Good examples of
methods that require application tokens are metadata or taxonomy calls.
The authorization code grant flow
is used to mint user tokens which are used for methods that do post or return data that is specific to an eBay user. There are a lot more methods that require user tokens than
application tokens. The
OAuth scope
section in each method's reference page indicates which tokens are needed for that method.
Scopes and refresh tokens
When creating a User access token, you must supply a list of scopes in your consent request. (See
Getting the list of scopes assigned to your application
). For more details, see
The authorization code grant flow
.
When requesting a refresh token, you can either:
include an optional
scope
parameter to supply a list of scopes; or
include no
scope
parameter and default to the set of scopes included in the consent request
Get OAuth access tokens
Minting access tokens
All eBay REST APIs use the
OAuth 2.0 protocol
for application and user authorization. OAuth is the industry standard for assuring your online transactions are secure and you must provide a valid access token for each request you
make to the eBay REST interfaces.
OAuth
access tokens
verify to eBay that a request is coming from a valid application and that the application has the user's authorization to carry out the requests.
Once you obtain a valid access token, use it to authorize a request.
Important!
You must have an active eBay Developer Program account to get the OAuth 2.0 client credentials you need to create access tokens.
Minting access tokens
The eBay token service generates, or
mints
, access tokens via two different grant flows:
Client credentials grant
flow mints a new
Application access token
that you can use to access the resources owned by the application.
Authorization code grant
flow mints a new
User access token
that you can use to access the resources owned by the user.
The eBay OAuth client libraries
eBay offers several client libraries that you can use to quickly implement the minting of OAuth tokens in your applications:
OAuth client library for Android
OAuth client library for C#
OAuth client library for Java
OAuth client library for Node.js
OAuth client library for Python
Implementing OAuth in your applications
The following topics describe how to implement the minting of OAuth tokens using each of the two grant flows:
The client credentials grant flow
The authorization code grant flow
Getting your redirect_uri value
The requests to get user access tokens require a
redirect_url
value that is used for authorization, as well as a URL to redirect the user to after they have completed the permissions grant request. Instead of a URL, the OAuth flow requires a
custom
RuName
value that eBay generates and assigns to your application.
About RuName values
The RuName contains several pieces of information, including the accept URL and reject URLvalues, which lets you customize different pages, depending on how the user responds
to the permissions grant request.
Your application has two unique RuName values, each supports either the Sandbox or Production environments.
Getting your RuName values
To get the RuName:
Log in to the eBay Developer Program and navigate to
Your Account > Application Keys
(if you followed the above step, you're already here).
Click the
User Tokens
link that's displayed next to your Client ID:
This displays the
Get a Token from eBay via Your Application
drop-down.
Click the
Get a Token from eBay via Your Application
drop down, the following screen displays:
If you have not yet created an RuName (also known as an
eBay Redirect URL name
), click the link labeled
You have no Redirect URLs. Click here to add one.
This displays the
Confirm the Legal Address for the Primary Contact or Business
form.
Complete the form to confirm your contact information, then click the
Continue to create RuName
button.
The RuName value is displayed on the resulting screen:
The RuName value for the Sandbox environment
If you are only using Application token, you do not need to fill out the rest of the RuName fields. URLs to your privacy policy and your accept and decline URLs are needed only if you
are using User access tokens.
If you are using User tokens, fill out the rest of the RuName form, as detailed below.
Configuring the RuName value
The
Get a Token from eBay via Your Application
box contains various fields that configure the RuName for User tokens. These are shown in the screen below:
The RuName value for the Sandbox environment
Configure the following fields before using the RuName to create a User token:
Field Name
Description
Display Title
The title that eBay displays at the top of the
Grant Application Access
page during the client-grant flow.
Privacy Policy URL
Enter the URL where you host your privacy policy. This policy states how you use the eBay information that your application can access when a user grants permission to your
application.
Auth Accepted URL
eBay redirects the user to this URL if the user grants your application the permissions it needs to act upon their behalf.
Auth Declined URL
eBay redirects the user to this URL if the user does not grant your application the permissions it needs.
Generating your Base64-encoded credentials
To authorize an API request, set the value of the
Authorization
header to the Base-64 encoded value of your application's OAuth credentials.
Before encoding the credentials, combine them by listing the
client_id
value, a colon, then the
secret
value.
In other words, Base64 encode the following: <
client_id
:
<
client_secret
For the
Authorization
header value, precede your B64-encoded credentials with the word "
Basic "
and a space, as demonstrated here:
Basic <
B64-encoded_oauth_credentials
When you navigate to get your application keys, you can quickly generate a short-lived (two hours or less) Application access token or User Access token through the user interface.
Getting Application access tokens via the Developer Portal
To get an Application access token:
Navigate to your
Application Keys
page on the eBay Developer Portal.
Next to the
App ID
listing of the environment you want to generate a token for, click the
User Tokens
link.
On the resulting page, click the
Get OAuth Application Token
link, an example which is highlighted in the following screen:
Getting an Application token through the Web flow
You can use this Application token to make requests to the APIs in the environment for which the token was generated.
Getting User access tokens via the Developer Portal
You can also generate a User access token through the Developer Portal.
To generate a User access token through the Developer Portal:
Navigate to your
Application Keys
page on the eBay Developer Portal.
Next to the
App ID
value (for Production or Sandbox environment), click the
User Tokens
link.
In the
Get a User Token Here
section, select the
OAuth (new security)
radio button, then click the sign-in button.
If you are generating a Production user token, a real eBay user's credentials will be provided. If you are generating a Sandbox user token, a Sandbox test user's credentials will be
provided.
On the Grant Application Access page (which is determined by the Accept URL setting), click the
Agree
button.
The User access token is returned.
You can use this User token to make requests to the APIs in the environment for which the token was generated. However, because the User access token is short lived, you will
likely want to programmatically generate your User tokens, including using the Refresh token to update your User tokens after they expire. See
Using a refresh token to update a User access token
.
OAuth best practices
This topic discusses the details and best practices for working with the eBay OAuth implementation.
Security and OAuth tokens
Access tokens are
short lived
—they expire quickly for security reasons—while refresh tokens are valid for an extended period of time. Refresh tokens are limited in functionality, however, and you can only use
them to get a new access token (you cannot use refresh tokens to authorize requests).
Even though you cannot make a call with a refresh token, you must still consider them as sensitive and you must store them in a secure location. Like an access token or client
secret, if the value of a refresh token is considered compromised, you should take immediate action to limit any possible repercussions that could stem from its misuse.
Important!
OAuth tokens and credentials MUST be treated as confidential and must not be shared or exposed publicly. For the best performance and security, applications should store access
tokens in memory and re-use them until they expire.
Testing with the Sandbox
The tokens you mint with the OAuth token requests work only in the environment for which the token was minted. There are three token requests for User access tokens, and you
must be sure to align the target environment for each request.
When you test with User access tokens, you need to get "consent" from your Sandbox test user accounts. However, once you've finished testing, get Production access tokens by
redoing the access-token flow using your Production OAuth credentials and the Production URLs. To do so, start the process afresh from the consent request step, as outlined in the
topic
Getting the third-party consent
. The difference here is that you will be getting consent from the real users of your app, and not your Sandbox test accounts.
OAuth token best practices
The following list presents some best practices for working with access tokens and their rate limits:
Access tokens are short-lived in that they expire relatively quickly after they have been minted. This is a security measure meant to keep ill-intended users from abusing access
tokens. Use an access token until it expires, then create a new one using either a client credentials grant for Application access tokens or a refresh token grant for User access
tokens.
Refresh tokens are long-lived, but they can be unexpectedly revoked. For example, the associated user can change their eBay user name or they can revoke their consent. In
addition, eBay can revoke a token for various reasons. With these scenarios in play, your application needs to gracefully handle User access token revocations.
Refresh tokens are valid for an extended period of time. When a refresh token expires, you must issue another permissions grant request to mint a new User access token for the
respective user.
Even while access tokens are short lived, eBay strictly enforces a daily rate limit on the number of tokens you can mint with each type of grant request. Make sure your application
stays within the request limits for your OAuth tokens.
Create your User access tokens using all the scopes needed for the current capabilities in your application, plus any capabilities you plan to add to the application. Adding a new
scope to an existing User access token requires a new permission grant from each of your users, and they might balk at multiple consent requests.
Create tokens using only the scopes your application needs. For example, there is no need to specify a read-only scope if the corresponding view and manage scope is also being
specified.
Store your OAuth credentials and refresh tokens on a secure server to prevent them from being hacked and used by bad actors for corrupt or possibly unlawful behavior.
Access token rate limits
To help prevent nefarious use of the eBay APIs, each application has a limit on the number of requests it can make to the OAuth endpoint in any one 24-hour day. The number of
requests allocated to an application is called the
rate limit
for that application.
The OAuth rate limits are assigned to the endpoint that an application uses to mint OAuth access tokens (
https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token (https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token)
), and the rate limits are different for each
grant_type
value. The following table shows the rate limits for the different types of
grant_type

The processes in this topic describe how to manually get OAuth tokens. To help with this process, eBay offers several client libraries that you can use to quickly implement the minting
of OAuth tokens in your applications:
OAuth client library for Android

OAuth client library for Java
OAuth client library for Node.js
OAuth client library for Python
Sequence for getting and using an application access token
The following sequence diagram outlines the client credentials grant flow, where an Application access token is minted, then used in an API request:
Sequence diagram for generating an Application access token
Configuring the request
You need to configure three parts of a client credentials grant request:
Setting the target endpoint
Configuring the HTTP request headers
Configuring the request payload
Setting the target endpoint
The endpoint you use depends on the environment you're targeting:
OAuth token-request endpoints
Environment
Endpoint (HTTP method + URL)
Sandbox
POST https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token (https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token)
Production
POST https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token (https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token)
Configuring the HTTP request headers
Set the following HTTP request headers:
Content-Type
– Must be set to:
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization
– The word "
Basic
" followed by your Base64-encoded OAuth credentials (
<client_id>
:
<client_secret>
).
For details, see
Generating your Base64-encoded credentials
.
Configuring the request payload
Format the payload of your
POST
request with the following values:
Set
grant_type
to
client_credentials
.
Set
scope
to the URL-encoded space-separated list of the scopes needed for the interfaces you call with the access token.
For details, see
Specifying scopes when minting access tokens
.
With Application access tokens, the application has an inherent authorization to make eBay calls.
The client credentials grant request
The client credentials grant is a single request that mints a new Application access token. Use the token to make requests to API methods that match the scopes configured into the
access token.
Configure your request using the following call specifics:
HTTP method:
POST
URL (Sandbox):
https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token (https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token)
HTTP headers:
Content-Type = application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization = Basic <
B64-encoded-oauth-credentials
Request body:
grant_type=
client_credentials
scope= // a URL-encoded string of space-separated scopes
Tip: The example on this page targets the Sandbox. Be sure to update the endpoint shown if you want to target the Production environment.
Example cURL request
The following command shows how to configure the client credentials grant request with cURL:
curl -X POST 'https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-H 'Authorization: Basic UkVTVFRlc3...wZi1hOGZhLTI4MmY=' \
-d '
grant_type
=client_credentials&
scope
=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.ebay.com%2Foauth%2Fapi_scope %20https%3A%2F%2Fapi.ebay.com%2Foauth%2Fapi_scope%2Fbuy.item.bulk'
Response containing the Application access token
When you issue a client credentials grant request, eBay returns a JSON object that contains an Application access token, as shown in this response:
{
"access_token": "v1.1#i
1#p1#r
0#I3#f
0#t^H4s ... wu67e3xAhskz4DAAA",
"expires_in": 7200,
"token_type": "Application Access Token"
}
To use an access token to authorize an API request, pass the token value in the Authorization HTTP header.
In the above example, the
expires_in
element is set to 7,200 seconds, meaning this token is valid for two hours from the time it was generated. For continued access after the token expires, you must mint a new token.
Important!
Access tokens
must
be treated as confidential and must not be shared or exposed publicly. For best performance and security, applications should store this token in a static variable and re-use the token
while it is valid.

Sequence for getting and using a user access token
The following sequence diagram outlines the authorization code grant flow, where a User access token is minted, then used in an API request:
Sequence diagram for generating a User access token
Getting a new access token for a user through the authorization code grant flow is a two-step process. First get consent from the eBay user to make API calls on their behalf (see
Getting user consent
), and then generate the User access token for each user (see
Exchanging the authorization code for a User access token
).
Getting user consent
This topic covers
user consent
, the first step you must take to get User access token for a specific user.
About user consent
If your eBay application acts on the behalf of an eBay user, your application must obtain the user's consent before it can make requests that access and update that user's
confidential resources.
After gaining the eBay user's consent, make an authorization code grant request to mint a new User access token, a token that carries a user's authorization to let your application
access the user's eBay account data.
Configuring the consent request
You need to configure two parts of the redirect URL:
Setting the target endpoint
Configuring the HTTP query parameters
Setting the target endpoint
The eBay Sandbox and Production environments host
Grant Application Access
pages on different servers. The following table lists the supported endpoints:
OAuth token-request endpoints
Environment
Endpoint (HTTP method + URL)
Sandbox
GET https://auth.sandbox.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize (https://auth.sandbox.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize)
Production
GET https://auth.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize (https://auth.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize)
Configuring the HTTP query parameters
Set the following query parameters to configure your consent request:
Consent Request URL Query Parameters
Query Parameter
Description
client_id
The
client_id
value for the environment you're targeting.
Occurrence:
Required
locale
The
locale
parameter to localize the OAuth consent page for the marketplace you're targeting. For example, set
locale=de-DE
for Germany. See the
Locale Support
column of the
Marketplace ID values
table for the supported locales.
Occurrence:
Optional
prompt
If needed, you can force a user to log in when you redirect them to the
Grant Application Access
page, even if they already have an existing user session. To do so, set the
prompt
query parameter to
login
.
Occurrence:
Optional
redirect_uri
The
RuName
value for the environment you're targeting.
For details, see
Getting your redirect_uri value
.
Occurrence:
Required
response_type
Set to "
code
" to have eBay generate and return an
authorization code
.
Occurrence:
Required
scope
A list of OAuth scopes that provide access to the resources used by your application.
For details, see
Using OAuth to access eBay APIs
Occurrence:
Required
state
An opaque value used by the client to maintain state between the request and callback.
The authorization server returns the same value supplied in the request when it redirects the user-agent back to the client's accept URL. While the
state
value is optional, we recommend you supply this value and use it to prevent cross-site request forgery, as described in
Section 10.12
of the OAuth spec.
Occurrence:
Optional
The consent request
You obtain user consent via your application's
Grant Application Access
page, a custom page that asks the user to grant your application the permissions it needs to access the user's eBay account resources.
From your application, direct the user to your application's
Grant Application Access
page using an HTML redirect that we call the "consent request."
The following consent request is an HTML redirect that targets the Sandbox (the example has been wrapped for readability):
/* URL redirects a user to the application's
Grant Application Access
page */
GET https://auth.sandbox.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize (https://auth.sandbox.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize)?
client_id=
&
locale=
& // optional
prompt=login // optional
redirect_uri=
&
response_type=code
&
scope=
& // a URL-encoded string of space-separated scopes
state=
& // optional
This HTML request redirects a user to your application's
Grant Application Access
page. If they consent to the conditions outlined on the page, the redirect returns the user to your application, and the redirect back to your application contains an
authorization code
.
The
Grant Application Access
lists the permissions your app needs to access and modify the specific confidential resources that are in your application's control. The list of permissions presented on the
Grant Application Access
page, and the full list of permissions to which the third-party must consent, is determined by the list of scopes supplied in your permissions grant request.
The list of permissions your app needs to access the eBay APIs determined by the list of scopes supplied in your permissions grant request. The more scopes you include in your
permissions grant request, the more permissions the user needs to consent. To trim the list of permissions that the user must consent to, supply only the scopes required to access
the methods used in your application, and leave out any scopes that signal access to resources that your application doesn't use.
The Grant Application Access page
The
Grant Application Access
page displays information about the items you're asking the user to grant access permission for your application. The page contains an
Agree and Continue
button that the user can click to indicate
consent
(it also contains a
Not now
button to indicate denial).
The
Grant Application Access
page has several links that provide information about the grant request and links that forward the user back to the seller's application. The seller configures much of the links and
content on this page through their eBay Developer Program account. (See
Getting your redirect_uri value
for more details.)
An example Grant Application Access page
The consent request
If the user grants consent by clicking the "
I Agree
" button on the
Grant Application Access
page, eBay redirects them back to the seller's
Accept URL
page (configured with the seller's RuName). The redirect back to your application includes an
authorization code
, which indicates the user's consent.
/* The redirect to your
Accept URL
page with the appended authorization code and state value */
https://www.example.com/acceptURL.html (https://www.example.com/acceptURL.html)?
state=<
client_supplied_state_value
&
code=v%5E1.1% ... NjA%3D
&
expires_in=299
The example above shows how the authorization code value is returned in the
code
parameter. The authorization code is tied a single user and you exchange the code for a User access token that is also tied to that user.
If you supplied a
state
parameter in your consent request, it is also returned in the redirect URL. eBay highly recommends you use this parameter to check for cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
About the authorization code
The authorization code returned from the authorization code grant is a single-use token that can be used only to retrieve an access token. You cannot use the authorization code to
make API requests.
In addition to the
code
value, the response URL also contains an associated
expires_in
value that defines the number of seconds the authorization code is valid. Use the authorization code before it expires to obtain a User access token that you can use to make
API requests on the user's behalf.
For details, see
Exchanging the authorization code for a User access token
.
Exchanging the authorization code for a User access token
When a user grants your application the authorization to take action on their behalf, eBay returns an
authorization code
that contains the user's consent for the specified scopes. Use the authorization code in a
POST
request that's commonly known as an
authorization code grant request
. This request gets a User access token and its associated refresh token.
The authorization code is a maximum of 1024 characters in length. Do not store this value, instead use the value only as a run-time parameter that's passed directly to the
authorization code grant.
Configuring the request
You need to configure three parts of a client credentials grant request:
Setting the target endpoint
Configuring the HTTP request headers
Configuring the request payload
Setting the target endpoint
The endpoint you use depends on the environment you're targeting:
OAuth token-request endpoints
Environment
Endpoint (HTTP method + URL)
Sandbox
POST https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token (https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token)
Production
POST https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token (https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token)
Configuring the HTTP request headers
Set the following HTTP request headers:
Content-Type
– Must be set to:
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization
– The word
Basic
followed by your Base64-encoded OAuth credentials (
<client_id>
:
<client_secret>
)
For details, see
Generating your Base64-encoded credentials
.
Configuring the request payload
Format the payload of your
POST
request with the following values:
Set
grant_type
to
authorization_code
.
Set
redirect_uri
to the
RuName
value assigned to your application and the environment you're targeting.
For details, see
Getting your redirect_uri value
.
Set
code
to the URL-encoded
authorization code
value returned to you by eBay when the user granted their consent.
For details, see
Getting the third-party's consent
.
Tip:The authorization code returned by eBay is URL-encoded. This value must be URL-encoded when you pass the value in the
code
parameter of the authorization code grant request. However, if the method you use to make the request URL-encodes the values you pass, then you must URL-decode the
authorization code before using it the authorization code grant request.
The authorization code grant request
The authorization code grant is a request that mints a new User access token. Use the token to make requests to API methods that match the scopes configured into the access
token.
Configure your request using the following call specifics:
HTTP method:
POST
URL (Sandbox):
https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token (https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token)
HTTP headers:
Content-Type = application/x-www-form-urlencoded

redirect_uri
=Davy_Developer-DavyDeve-DavysT-euiukxwt'
Response containing the User access token
When you issue the authorization code grant request, eBay returns a JSON object containing the fields shown here:
{
"access_token": "v1.1#i
1#p3#r
1...XzMjRV4xMjg0"
,
"expires_in": 7200,
"refresh_token": "v^1.1#i^1#p^3#r^1...zYjRV4xMjg0",
"refresh_token_expires_in": 47304000,
"token_type": "User Access Token"
}
Use the access token to authorize your API requests.
Because this example targets the Sandbox environment, this access token can be used to make API calls to only the Sandbox. To make requests to the Production environment,
repeat the token-generating process using the Production environment values (the OAuth credentials, RuName, and URLs) in each of the token requests you sent to eBay.
About the User access token
The
expires_in
value returned with the newly-minted User access token indicates the number of seconds that token is valid.
In the example above, the token remains valid for 7,200 seconds (2 hours) from the time it was generated. After the token expires, you will need to renew it using the supplied refresh
token.
The refresh token
While User access tokens are
short-lived
, the associated
refresh_token
is a
long-lived
value that you can use to update an expired User access token. This means you do not have to get the user's consent each time you need a new User access token.
To update the access token after it expires, see
Using a refresh token to update a User access token
.
Using a refresh token to update a User access token
When you mint a new User access token, the access token is returned along with a
refresh token
, which you can use to renew the User access token for the associated user. A
refresh token request
mints an access token that contains the same authorization properties as the original access token.
About refresh tokens
For security, a User access token is short-lived. However, a refresh token is long-lived and you can use it to renew a User access token after the token expires. The benefit is that you
don't need to get the account-owner's consent each time you need to renew their User access token.
The sequence for using a refresh token
The application can make API calls on the eBay user's behalf as long as the access token associated with their account is valid. If the access token is expired, renew the User access
token using the following logic:
Sequence diagram for generating a User access token with a refresh token
Configuring the refresh token request
You need to configure three parts of a refresh token request:
Setting the target endpoint
Configuring the HTTP request headers
Configuring the request payload
Setting the target endpoint
The endpoint you use depends on the environment you're targeting:
OAuth token-request endpoints
Environment

Production
POST https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token (https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token)
Configuring the HTTP request headers
Set the following HTTP request headers:
Content-Type
– Must be set to:
application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization
– The word
Basic
followed by your Base64-encoded OAuth credentials (
<client_id>
:
<client_secret>
)
For details, see
Generating your Base64-encoded credentials
.
Configuring the request payload
Format the payload of your
POST
request with the following values:
Set
grant_type
to
refresh_token
.
Set
refresh_token
to the refresh token value returned from the authorization code grant request.
To get a refresh token, you must mint a new User access token.
This process starts with
Getting the user's consent
.
Set
scope
to the same URL-encoded list of scopes that you used in the original consent request.
For details on scopes, see
Using OAuth to access eBay APIs
.
Note:
The
scope
parameter is optional. If you do not specify a
scope
parameter, the default will be the set of scope values included in the consent request. If you do specify a
scope
parameter, the included scope values must be equal to or a subset of the scope values included in the consent request.
The refresh token request
To update an expired User access token using a refresh token request, configure the target URL, HTTP headers, and request payload as shown here:
HTTP method:
POST
URL (Sandbox):
https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token (https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token)

https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.inventory'
Response containing the updated User access token
When you issue the refresh token request, eBay mints a fresh access token and sends it back in a JSON response similar to the following:
{
"access_token": "v^1.1#i ... AjRV4yNjA=",
"expires_in": 7200,
"token_type":"User Access Token"
}
About refresh tokens
You can continue to use the refresh token to mint new User access tokens for a specific user, as long as the refresh token associated with their account is valid. Note, however, that if
the long-lived refresh token expires, or if you update the scopes needed by your app, you must update both the access token and the refresh token, starting with
Getting the third-party consent
.
While you can track the lifespan of each access token and refresh them before they expire, the amount of processing and storage needed to track the lifespans of multiple tokens
often outweighs the processing needed to refresh a token once it has expired. For this reason, it is best to refresh each access token after it expires (and you receive an "
Invalid access token
" error), rather than trying to renew each token before it expires.
Important!
Refresh tokens can be revoked due to various merchant activity on eBay. Specifically, if a seller changes their eBay member log-in name or the password for their eBay account, any
active refresh tokens associated with the account will be automatically revoked by eBay. In addition, sellers can choose to revoke a token themselves via their eBay account pages.
If your refresh token gets revoked (or if it expires), then you must redo the consent-request flow in order to get a new access token and refresh token for the associated user.
Understand AuthnAuth tokens
Life Span and Uniqueness
Hard Expiration Warning Element
Revoked tokens
There are two application use cases, or models. The models differ only by the number of users supported by the application.
In the
Single User Model
, the application supports only a single user. In this model, you need only one Auth'n'Auth token. You can generate a single token for your application's user with the
User Tokens (eBay Sign-In)
page in your developer account. An Auth'n'Auth token created in the Production environment is associated with an eBay user ID, and an auth'n'auth token created in the Sandbox
environment is associated with a Sandbox test user.
In the
Solutions Provider Model
, the application supports multiple users. For this you would want to implement the ability to get user tokens directly from within your application. The following sections describe how
to configure your application to get tokens for eBay users, how to get tokens that will enable users to make use of your application, how to use tokens, and how to replace them when
they expire.
The following tutorial walks you through setting up your application to receive tokens and receiving a token for a user.
Life Span and Uniqueness
Typically, an application obtains a user token for each user via the user sign-in and consent process and stores the token for subsequent use. If you will be storing user tokens in a
database, here's what you need to know.
It can be up to 2KB in length and is base 64 encoded
It can contain: a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, asterisk, slash, plus ( * / +)
Tokens are valid for 18 months across multiple sessions of the application. Seven (7) days before a token is due to expire, eBay returns the expiration date in the
HardExpirationWarning Element
field in the response of all calls the application makes on behalf of that eBay user. When your application detects this field, it must redirect the user to the sign-in page on the eBay
site by the date in this warning, or the token ceases to work as a means to authenticate that eBay user.
Applications are notified at least seven days before the expiration of a token at the end of its lifetime, so that they can initiate the process of generating a new token for the user. A
new token is usually generated before the old one actually expires. But note, the creation of a new token for a given application/user combination invalidates the prior token.
eBay recommends messaging end users several months before the token expiration date to ensure the user has plenty of time to reauthorize your application. Keep track of the date
on which you created the token, and assume that it should be valid for 18 months unless otherwise indicated by eBay.
If a token expires and no new token is generated, the application will be unable to make API calls in that user's name. This has no effect on the user's eBay account or any other
application that they use. Once a new token has been generated, the application will again be able to make function calls on that user's behalf. See
Token Expiration Causes
for a list of what can cause a token to expire.
Once a token has expired, all calls using that token will fail with error 932: "Auth token is hard expired." To avoid unexpected user token failures, your application should include logic
to handle this error.
Hard Expiration Warning Element
In SOAP-formatted calls, the seven-day warning is returned in the HardExpirationWarning element. The element is returned in the header of the response to an API call made within
the 7-day warning period.

Revoked tokens
EBay users can revoke tokens by going to the Third-party app access page in My eBay.
When a user revokes a token for an application, that token expires immediately. Any API calls made with the expired token fail with an error (error code 16110).
eBay revokes a token due to security concerns
If eBay detects suspicious activity that indicates a possible security compromise of an account or application, all affected user tokens are revoked immediately. Any API calls made
with the revoked token fail (error code 17470).
Get AuthnAuth tokens
Client/Desktop Applications
Web/Server Applications
Getting a Token via Fetch Token
Using Tokens
Here is a summary of the process that results in your application getting a token for a user:
A user indicates a desire to use your application.
Your application requests a session ID from eBay, and receives one.
Your application constructs a URL that contains the session ID and an identifier for your application, and uses this URL to send the user to the eBay sign-in page.
The user signs in to eBay.
eBay serves the user the consent form for your application.
The user consents.
If your application hosts an AcceptURL, eBay serves the user back to that URL.
Your application requests a token for the user, who is identified in the request by the session ID.
eBay returns a token to your application.
Getting a token is a slightly different process for web-enabled applications (which can host AcceptURL and RejectURL) than it is for client desktop applications (which do not host
URLs).
The following sections describe the processes for client/desktop applications and for web applications.
Client/Desktop Applications
Use this method of getting tokens if there is no web component to your application, or you do not wish to host an AcceptURL or RejectURL page.
In this process, some of the steps are completed by the user, some by eBay, and some by your application.
A user indicates an intention to use your application (for example, by clicking a Subscribe button in your application interface).
Your application makes a
GetSessionID
request to eBay, and receives a session ID (
SessionID
).
GetSessionID
is described in reference detail at
GetSessionID
.
Your application uses the session ID to construct an eBay sign-in URL that sends the user to the eBay sign-in page and consent form.
Use the following URL to redirect a user to the eBay sign-in page:
https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn&RUName=RUName&SessID=SessionID (https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?
SignIn&RUName=RUName&SessID=SessionID)
The URL must include
&SessID
=SessionID
and &RUName=
RUName
.
SessionID
identifies the user and
RUName
the application. The SessionID must be URL-encoded in the sign-in URL.
The equivalent URL for the Sandbox is:
https://signin.sandbox.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll (https://signin.sandbox.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll)
SignIn&RUName=
RUName
&SessID=
SessionID
. The user signs in on the eBay sign-in page.
eBay forwards the user to your application's consent form.
The user consents or rejects your application.
eBay forwards the user to an eBay page that confirms their action.
Your application calls
FetchToken
to retrieve the user token.
Here is a summary of the process that results in your web application getting a token for a user:
See
Getting a Token via FetchToken
.
Option 1: User Sign-in Flow Ends on eBay; Client/Desktop Application Uses FetchToken to Retrieve Token
Web/Server Applications
Use this method for getting tokens if your application has a web component and can respond to being redirected to the URLs specified in your developer account.
In this process, some of the steps are completed by the user, some by eBay, and some by your application.
A user indicates an intention to use your application (for example, by clicking a Subscribe button in your application interface).
Your application makes a
GetSessionID
request to eBay.
GetSessionID
is described in reference detail at
GetSessionID.
Your application receives session ID (
SessionID
).
Your application constructs an eBay sign-in URL that sends the user to the eBay sign-in page and consent form.
Sign-in URL for production tokens:
https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn&RUName= (https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn&RUName=)
RUName
&SessID=
SessionID
Sign-in URL for Sandbox:
https://signin.sandbox.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn&RUName= (https://signin.sandbox.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn&RUName=)
RUName
&SessID=
SessionID
In the URL,
SessionID
identifies the user and
RUName
the application.
SessionID
must be URL-encoded in the sign-in URL. It is the session ID that was obtained by calling
GetSessionID
.
Note that in a web application, you can construct an eBay sign-in URL using an HTML form that contains a Submit button. For example:
<INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME=AUTHORIZE VALUE="Launch Auth & Auth"
onclick="window.open('https://signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn&RUName=$RUName&SessID=$SessionID');">\n
Your application can use an additional parameter in the sign-in URL,
ruparams
, to hold user data that you want passed back to your application after the user consents. After user consent, eBay adds the
ruparams
information to the URL that directs the user back to your AcceptURL or RejectURL page. This data is not used in any way by eBay.
The data you pass in
ruparams
may consist of zero or more pieces of information, each in a variable name and URL-encoded value format. When eBay redirects to your application's AcceptURL or RejectURL, the
value of ruparams is URL decoded into name-value pairs. For example, if the application sends this:
...&ruparams=VarA%3DB12309%26VarB%3DABC123
eBay returns this in the URL:
...&VarA=B12309&VarB=ABC123
The user signs in on the eBay sign-in page.
eBay forwards the user to your application's consent form.
In the consent form, the user consents or rejects your application.
eBay redirects consenting users back to the application's AcceptURL, and rejecting users to the application's Reject URL.
If you have passed user data in
ruparams
in the sign-in URL, eBay appends this data to the AcceptURL or RejectURL.
Your application should present rejecting users with a meaningful error or message indicating that the application will be unable to make API calls in the user's name (that is, the user
cannot use your application).
The application calls
FetchToken
to retrieve the user token.
See
Getting a Token via FetchToken
.
With one-time setup complete, your application can respond to prospective users and get tokens for them.
If the application only has one user, the same process outlined in the
Getting access tokens through the Developer Portal
can also be used for Auth'n'Auth user tokens. The process for getting user tokens for both OAuth and Auth'n'Auth are basically the same, except that the
Auth'n'Auth
radio button will be selected in the User Tokens page.
Sign-in Web Application Flow Returns User to Web Application; Application Uses FetchToken to Retrieve Token
Getting a Token via Fetch Token
Once the processes described in
Client/Desktop Applications
or
Web/Server Applications
have been completed, from your desktop or web application use
FetchToken
to retrieve tokens for its users.
When a user hits the eBay sign-in URL your application constructed during the consent process, eBay generates a user token and stores it with a user's session ID for 48 hours.
If this is your application's first time using this process to obtain a token for a user, your application should wait 5-10 seconds before calling
FetchToken
.
This section contains examples of using
FetchToken
.
FetchToken
is described in reference detail in
FetchToken
.
The SOAP API example below shows a
FetchToken
call with the requester credentials in the SOAP header:
Fetching a Token Programmatically with SOAP
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
xmlns:xs="https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"

</Credentials>
</ebl:RequesterCredentials>
</soap:Header>
<SessionID>MySessionID</SessionID>
<Version>1169</Version>
</soap:Envelope>
Instead of passing in application keyset values into the
Credentials
container in the request payload, you can also pass the application keyset values in through HTTP headers. The XML API example below shows the
FetchToken
call with the requester credentials in the HTTP header:
X-EBAY-API-APP-NAME:MyAppID
X-EBAY-API-DEV-NAME:MyDevID
X-EBAY-API-CERT-NAME:MyCertID

Using Tokens
To authenticate the requester for a SOAP API call using a user token, pass the token in the header for the request. The SOAP API example below shows the header element that
contains the token in
bold
.

Using OAuth with the eBay traditional APIs
Authorizing API requests
Standardizing on OAuth
OAuth scopes and the traditional APIs
Implementing OAuth instead of Auth'n'Auth
You can use OAuth access tokens to make requests to several of the traditional eBay APIs, include the Trading API, the Post Order API.
Authorizing API requests
Before the introduction of the eBay RESTful APIs, all requests to the traditional APIs require you to authorize your requests with a system that's known as Auth'n'Auth (which stands
for
authentication and authorization
).
As you begin to use the new eBay RESTful APIs, you'll find the APIs require you to use OAuth
access tokens
for authorization. This can be confusing because it appears that you need to use two separate authorization mechanisms if you want to use multiple eBay APIs.
Standardizing on OAuth
The good news is that we're retooling some traditional APIs to support OAuth as an authorization mechanism. With this upgrade, you can now use OAuth tokens to authorize the
requests you make to the following traditional APIs:
Trading API
Post Order API
Business Policy Management API
All of the above APIs require user access tokens created with
The authorization code grant flow
. Later in this section, the methods for passing in OAuth tokens for each of these APIs are explained.
Like Auth'n'Auth, the OAuth authorization code grant flow involves delegation via a
user consent
. With this, your application must redirect the user to a
Grant Application Access Page
so they can consent to the eBay terms and conditions of use. And now that some traditional APIs support OAuth for authorization, you can get a user's consent just once, after which
you can call any of the APIs that support OAuth for the eBay user.
OAuth scopes and the traditional APIs
The traditional APIs do not use OAuth scopes.
Implementing OAuth instead of Auth'n'Auth
This section details how to use OAuth instead of Auth'n'Auth in the supported traditional APIs.
Using OAuth in Trading API requests
To make a Trading API request using OAuth:
Remove the
field and its associated value from the request payload (this field is used to pass your Auth'n'Auth credentials).
Add the
X-EBAY-API-IAF-TOKEN
HTTP request header to the request and populate its value with a valid User access token.
Here's an example of the HTTP request headers and the associated payload needed for a
GetCategories
request:
HTTP Headers

Note:
The Platform Notification calls
GetNotificationPreferences
and
SetNotificationPreferences
work with OAuth as outlined above, however your application needs to be white listed in order to receive platform notifications. Please contact
Developer Technical Support
for details on getting your application white listed.
Using OAuth in Post Order API requests
The Post Order API uses the
Authorization
HTTP request header to pass the OAuth token with your REST request. See
Post-Order API – Making a Call
for more information about using the Authorization header.
To make a Post Order API request using OAuth:
Populate the
Authorization
HTTP header value with "
IAF
" (with a space) followed by a valid User access token.
For example:
Authorization : IAF v^1.1...90nH9ZfwTJRzOfW4QAAA=
Using OAuth in Business Policy Management API requests
To make a Business Policy Management API request using OAuth:
Remove the HTTP header
X-EBAY-SOA-SECURITY-TOKEN
and its associated Auth'n'Auth token value from the request.
Add the HTTP header
X-EBAY-SOA-SECURITY-IAFTOKEN
and populate its value with a valid User access token.
Here's a section of the HTTP headers:
X-EBAY-SOA-SECURITY-IAFTOKEN : v^1.1...90nH9ZfwTJRzOfW4QAAA=

eBay APIs support a large number of applications and serve billions of API calls every month. To maintain a high level of availability and provide superior quality of service, eBay
limits the API call usage. The limits on the total calls and the rate at which the calls can be made depend on the API.
Our
default API call limits
are designed for individuals and smaller businesses. If your volume increases, you can get higher limits after completing our Application Growth Check.
After you
join
the eBay Developers Program and
get your application keyset
, you can start using eBay APIs immediately. The default call limits on the eBay APIs allow you to test and explore the API capabilities. Many applications are able to perform all
capabilities using the default limits. If you need higher call limits, you can complete our
Application Growth Check
, to verify that your application is adhering to eBay's API License Agreement, and that you've made the most efficient use of the APIs you've implemented.

Using eBay RESTful APIs
Overview
This guide explains the high-level REST call and response mechanics. It also provides other information that you'll need as you write applications with the eBay APIs (including how
to generate OAuth tokens and how to parse error messages).
What is REST?
Benefits of using REST
What is REST?
REST stands for
Representational State Transfer
. Pragmatically, it means that you or your program communicates with a remotely-run service using standard web commands and protocols such as HTTP requests and responses.
You send the service an API command wrapped in an HTTP request, and it responds with a success or failure indicator and any results data, all wrapped in an HTTP response.
This means the REST API itself is stateless. State is maintained on either the client side or the service side, but not within the API. Thus the full name; Representational State
Transfer. REST APIs transfer state from client to server or vice versa.
Benefits of using REST
A key benefit of REST is that HTTP is widely used. Plus, sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses doesn't take much bandwidth.
In addition, the syntax and protocols used by REST (JSON and the URI addressing protocol) are well known and baked into how you already use the web. The underlying system has
already been built and installed, and it's available for anyone to use. This minimizes the amount of work users and developers have to do to get their applications up and running. In
theory, all RESTful APIs have the same, easy to learn, interface format.
REST architecture emphasizes that interactions between clients and services are enhanced by having a limited number of operations with which it acts. Specifically, there are four
common HTTP
methods
that give you full "CRUD" capabilities: Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete. Each of the main HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) has a specific meaning in the REST
architecture, and in this way REST avoids ambiguity. You can think of the HTTP methods as the
verbs
in a rest operation.
For flexibility, we assign
resources
their own unique Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs). Resources are the nouns in a REST operations, and often consist of either a single entity, or a group of like entities.
The topics in this guide cover the following information:
Making a call
— How to make calls to the eBay APIs in 3 steps.
Request Components
— What makes up a REST request, and how you put one together.
Response Components
— What makes up a REST response, and how you parse and interpret it.
Handling Error Messages
— This topic describes eBay's common format for how HTTP responses return error and warning messages.
Using API Explorer to run sample calls
— API Explorer is a tool that lets you run sample calls for all the methods in the eBay APIs.
Versioning and API lifecycle
— Each API travels through the API lifecycle, where it goes through the different stages of release, updates, and eventually deprecation.
Support for application development
— Where and how to get help if you have problems developing your application.
Making a call
To
make your first eBay REST API call, follow the steps below:
Step 1:
If you don’t have an eBay Developers Program account, follow the steps on
Join the eBay Developers Program
.
If you do have an account, skip to Step 2.
Step 2: Get an access token and create a keyset
Create a Sandbox or Production keyset by following the instructions in the
Create the eBay API keysets
topic.
Generate an OAuth application token for your application by following the instructions in the
The client credentials grant flow
topic.
Step 3:
Use the
API Explorer tool
to make a
getItemConditionPolicies
call. Use the application token you just created in Step 3
. See
Use the API Explorer to try out APIs
for more information.
Request components
The three main request components are itemized below, and covered in subsequent sub-sections:
HTTP request headers
REST API endpoints
Request payload
HTTP request headers
Every eBay REST API method requires at least one HTTP request header, and some methods require several headers.
These headers can include both standard HTTP headers and eBay custom headers. All eBay custom headers start with "
X-EBAY-C-
".
Some eBay custom headers are
packed headers
, meaning they can contain multiple name/value pairs. The format for a name/value pair is
=
, and you must separate multiple values in a single header by commas. The following example shows the general format:
X-EBAY-C-PACKED-EXAMPLE: fig=7,bar="quux",value=42
The table below presents the standard request headers that eBay accepts, as well as the custom eBay headers that you can use.
Note:
All headers should be treated as case-insensitive and must follow RFC standards.
HTTP headers for eBay REST requests
HTTP Header
Required
Description
Authorization
Required
Authorization
specifies the OAuth token and token type used to authorize the request.
You must supply this request header in each request you make to the eBay REST interfaces. For details, see
OAuth access tokens
.
Example:
Authorization: Bearer
Accept
Conditionally required
Accept
indicates the formats the client accepts for the response.
This header pairs with the
Content-Type
header, which specifies the format required by eBay for the request body. Currently, most eBay REST interfaces require request bodies to be formatted in JSON. See
Content-Type
Header for details and other supported headers.
JSON is the default and only format returned in response bodies.
Example:
Accept: application/json
Accept-Charset
Optional
Accept-Charset
indicates the character sets the client accepts for the response.
If the server cannot respond using the value specified in
Accept-Charset
, the server usually ignores the value and without an error responds in
utf-8
.
Example:
Accept-Charset: utf-8
Accept-Encoding
Optional –
Conditionally recommended
Accept-Encoding
indicates the compression-encoding algorithms the client accepts for the response.
We strongly recommend you include this header in all requests that can potentially return large response payloads. Compression encoding can increase performance by dramatically
reducing response-payload size.
Currently,
gzip
is the only supported compression format.
Example:
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Accept-Language
Conditionally required
Accept-Language
indicates the natural language and locale preferred by the client for the response.
While recommended for all requests, you must supply this header when you are targeting the specific locale of a marketplace that supports multiple locales. For example:
Use
fr-BE
when targeting the Française locale of the Belgium marketplace.
Use
fr-CA
when targeting the Française locale of the Canadian marketplace.
For the language values and locales supported by the different eBay marketplaces, see
Marketplace ID values
.
Example:
Accept-Language: fr-CA
Content-Type
Conditionally required
Content-Type
indicates the format of the request body provided by the client.
This header pairs with the
Accept
header, which indicates the formats the client accepts for the response. Currently, all Accept headers are formatted in JSON. See
Accept
Header for details.
This header is usually required for all
POST
and
PUT
operations. If omitted in the request, this header defaults to
application/json
. Supported values include:
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Language
Conditionally required
This header sets the natural language that will be used in request payload fields that support user-defined text. Supported values for this header include
en-US
for English or
de-DE
for German.
While recommended for all requests, you must supply this header when you are targeting the specific locale of a marketplace that supports multiple locales. For example:
Use
fr-BE
when targeting the Française locale of the Belgium marketplace.
Use
fr-CA
when targeting the Française locale of the Canadian marketplace.
For the language values and locales supported by the different eBay marketplaces, see
Marketplace ID values
.
In addition to this set of common HTTP headers, some methods or APIs make use of additional headers.
Check the documentation of the method for details on any additional headers that might be required to make a request to the interface.
Marketplace ID values

REST API endpoints
You make a RESTful request by addressing a
REST operation
, which is made up of an
HTTP method
and an associated
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
.
HTTP methods
All available HTTP methods are defined by the W3C in
RFC 9110, Section 9.3
. The following table shows the HTTP methods that eBay REST APIs support
:
HTTP methods
HTTP Method
Description
POST
POST methods request that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI. As examples, the POSTed data
could be an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a web form to
a data-handling process; or an item to add to a database.
PUT
PUT methods request that the enclosed entity (passed in the body of the request) be stored under the supplied URI. If the URI refers to an already existing resource, the resource is
modified. If the URI does not point to an existing resource, then the server can create the resource with that URI.
GET
GET methods request a representation of the specified resource. For example, a method that retrieves an address resource gets a
representation
of a specific address resource (or set of address resources). Requests using GET should only retrieve data, they should have no other effect or side-effect.
DELETE
DELETE methods remove the specified resource(s).
REST operation URIs
The URI part of a REST operation points to the
resource
upon which the operation acts. As an example, the following is a URI that is used in a
Fulfillment API
GET
operation to retrieve the contents of an order based on its unique identifier,
orderId
:
https://api.ebay.com/sell/fulfillment/v1/order/{orderId}?fieldGroups= (https://api.ebay.com/sell/fulfillment/v1/order/%7BorderId%7D?fieldGroups=)
string
This URI is created by combining several separate pieces of information:
The components of an eBay REST URI
URI Property
Description
https://api.ebay.com (https://api.ebay.com)
The domain where the API resides (the API location).
eBay supports different API
environments
, such as the production environment and the Sandbox environment. See
eBay API environments
for details on how to address the supported eBay API environments.
/sell
The API context (such as Buy, Sell, Commerce, or Developer).
/fulfillment
The API name.
/v1
The
major
version of the API.
/order
The resource upon which the operation acts. Some methods may act upon a specific instance of a resource, and other methods may act upon/retrieve multiple instances of the
resource. Unless the URI addresses a specific resource, the operation addresses a
resource collection
(a resource collection is a set of like resources).
/
Known as a
path parameter
, these are most often used to specify a specific instance of a resource.
?fieldGroups=
string
Some operations support one or more
query parameters
, which provide for more control over what is addressed by the operation.
URI parameters
As shown above, REST operations can include
parameters
in their URIs. Specifically, they can have both path parameters and query parameters:
Path parameters
are variables that are part of the "path" segment of an operation. Because these variables are part of the operation's path, they are always required.
Separate multiple query parameters with an ampersand ("&").
Query parameters
can be optional, conditionally required, or mandatory depending on the design of the REST method.
.
URL encoding query parameter values
While some path parameters do not require you to include a value for the parameter to take effect, some path parameters do required you to include a value with the parameter.
Consider a
sort
query parameter, which normally requires you to specify a field on which to sort the result.
Whenever path parameters require added values, you must
URL encode
the values you add. URL encoding is sometimes referred to as "
percent-encoding
."
Consider the following example:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&category_ids=15724&aspect_filter=categoryId:15724,Color:
The above URI includes three query parameters,
q
,
category_ids
, and
aspect_filter
. While the first two parameters are straight-forward, the third (
aspect_filter
) is a bit more complex, it specifies two separate values. Still, each of the values supplied to these query parameters must be URL encoded as the following table shows:
URL Encoding Query Parameter Values
Path Parameter Value
URL Encoded Value
shirt
shirt
15724
15724
categoryId:15724,Color:
categoryId%3A15724%2CColor%3A%7BRed%7D
As you can see, the URL encoding for the first two values does not alter their string values. However, the third value contains some characters that, when encoded, get rendered with
a special encoding. With this example, the full URL encoded URI to the operation is as follows:
/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&category_ids=15724&aspect_filter=categoryId%3A15724%2CColor%3A%7BRed%7D
For more on URL encoding, see
Percent-encoding
.
eBay API sandbox environment
Most eBay REST APIs support a sandbox environment where applications can be tested with various APIs before moving to the production environment. The reference
documentation for each method within a REST API will contain the Production URI and the Sandbox URI. Generally, the base URI paths are very similar. So if the base Production
URI is
https://api.ebay.com (https://api.ebay.com)
, the Sandbox URI will be
https://api.sandbox.ebay.com (https://api.sandbox.ebay.com)
.
For details on how to test using the sandbox, see
Create a test sandbox user
.
Request payload
A request body, often called a "payload," is provided with a request whenever you what to create or update a resource. In the eBay REST APIs, most request payloads and all
response payloads are formatted in JSON. The API Reference documentation describes the fields supported in the body of each method.
The following sample request payload is for a
POST https://api.ebay.com/sell/marketing/v1/item_promotion (https://api.ebay.com/sell/marketing/v1/item_promotion)
request, a
method
that creates an item discount:
{
"marketplaceId": "EBAY_US",
"inventoryCriterion": {
"listingIds": [
"142250172493",
"132073034350"
],
"inventoryCriterionType": "INVENTORY_BY_VALUE"
},
"endDate": "2027-03-01T20:00:00.000Z",
"discountRules": [
{
"discountSpecification": {
"numberOfDiscountedItems": 1,
"forEachQuantity": 1
},
"ruleOrder": 0,
"discountBenefit": {
"percentageOffItem": "5"
}
}
],
"name": "Buy 1 and get 2nd one 5% off -part 2",
"description": "Buy 1 and get 2nd one 5% off -part 2",
"startDate": "2025-02-11T19:58:18.918Z",
"promotionStatus": "DRAFT"
}
Response components
The three main response components are itemized below, and covered in subsequent sub-sections:
HTTP status codes
Response payload
HTTP response headers
HTTP status codes
Each response from a request to an eBay REST operation contains an
HTTP status code
that relays the status of your request. HTTP status codes are defined by W3C
RFC 2616, section 10
. The high-level codes are defined as follows:
HTTP status code
High-level HTTP Status Code
Description
1
xx
Informational
—Codes returned in the 100 range denote the response contains informational data, such as a switching protocol message.
2
xx
Success
—Codes returned in 200 range indicate the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted. While a code of
200
indicates
OK
, other 200 codes can indicate other types of success.
200
OK
—The request succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request.
201
Created
—The request was fulfilled and a new resource was created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s) returned
Location
header field.
202
Accepted
—The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
204
No Content
—The server fulfilled the request, but does not need to return an entity-body (payload).
3
xx
Redirection
—Codes returned in the 300 range indicate your request was redirected.
4
xx
Client Error
—Codes returned in the 400 range denotes that some sort of client error was encountered. Please check the error code for more information on the type of error encountered.
400
Bad Request—
The request could not be understood by the server due to a syntax error.
401
Unauthorized—
The request requires user authentication that was not provided, or user authentication was provided and has been rejected.
404
Not Found—
The server could not find anything matching the request URI.
5
xx
Server Error
—Codes returned in the 500 range denote an error occurred on the server side. Refer to the specific error for details.
Response payload
Like the request payloads, all successful responses from a call to an eBay REST operation contain payloads formatted in JSON (where applicable).
The following code example shows a response payload from a call to
GET https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/v1/deals (https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/v1/deals)
,
which contains
a list of the current eBay Deals items for a specified category:
{
"deals": [
{
"groupId": "v1|1***********|0",
"title": {
"content": "Apple iPhone 4S - 32GB - White Smartphone-14485"
},
"imageLink": "http://i.ebayimg.ebay.com/0*****/$_35.JPG",
"minPrice": {
"value": 300,
"currency": "USD"
},
"maxPrice": {
"value": 300,
"currency": "USD"
},
"categoryIdentifier": "Cell Phones & Smartphones",
"quantitySold": 12,
"discount": true,
"originalPrice": {
"value": 401,
"currency": "USD"
},
"quantityLimitPerBuyer": 5,
"priceDisplayCondition": "ALWAYS_SHOW",
"itemGroup": "/buy/v1/item_group/v1|1***********|0",
"dealEndtime": {
"value": "2024-11-27T14:59:00.000Z",
"formattedValue": "2024-11-27T14:59:00.000Z"
}
},
{
"groupId": "v1|1***********|0",
"title": {
"content": "Packing and Shipping boxes - 19273-1445985364525"
},
...
}
}
]
}
HTTP response headers
The response from each call to an eBay REST operation contains a set of
HTTP headers
. The headers returned by each operation are unique to the specific operation, although most operations do return the HTTP headers described in the following table.
Note:
All headers should be treated as case-insensitive and must follow RFC standards.
Common HTTP response headers
HTTP response header
Description
Content-type
Describes character set and/or MIME type of the response, which should be the same as the values specified in the
Accept-Charset
and
Accept-Encoding
request headers, respectively.
If the server cannot return the result specified in either of those request headers, the server usually ignores those values and returns the result in the value(s) specified by
Content-Type
, without returning an error code.
Note that there can be multiple Content-Type response headers, with one identifying the character set and another the MIME encoding.
Examples:
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Type: application/jsonl
Content-Type: charset=utf-8
Content-Language
Describes the natural language of the response. This should be the language specified in the
Accept-Language
request header. However, if the server cannot return the result in the value specified by
Accept-Language
, the server usually ignores Accept-Language, and returns a value that is either a language code or a language code with a country option (for example,
en-US
for United States English as opposed to British English). See
Marketplace ID and language header values
for the values supported by eBay.
Example:
Accept-Language: en-US
Location
When creating a new resource with a
POST
call, eBay does not return a response with a payload. Instead, the response contains a
Location
header that contains a URI to the newly-created resource. Parse the URI to get the ID of the resource, or you can use the URI in a
GET
request to retrieve the ID of the resource.
Warning
Carries additional information about the status or transformation of a message that might not be reflected in the status code.
Refer to the documentation on each REST operation for the specifics of the HTTP headers that can be returned by that call.
Note:
The eBay calls return multiple response headers. When contacting DTS for support, please be sure to track the response headers from the calls for which you have questions; they
help the support staff determine the specifics of call(s) you are referencing.
Handling errors
If your request encounters problems during processing, the eBay servers can respond with either an error or warning condition. While processing might continue if a warning is
encountered, the processing stops when errors are encountered.
API error and warning responses
Common errors
API error and warning responses
There are three different types of response components that you can receive after you send a request. Depending on what happens during the request processing, you can receive
either errors or warnings, as follows:
There is a
warnings
component and no
errors
component. This happens when no error occurred during processing, but one or more warnings occurred.
There is an
errors
component and no
warnings
component. This happens when one or more errors occurred during processing. While warnings may also have occurred during processing, they are not included in any response
with an error component.
There is neither an
errors
or
warnings
component. This happens when no warnings and no errors occurred during processing.
Returned error and warning objects are the same type (
ErrorData
) and have the same fields.
The following sections show typical responses for each of the three possibilities. The table in the
Error and warning field values
section below lists all fields that could be included in a response when either errors or warnings occurred during request processing.
A warning response
The following example shows a
warnings
response component with no
errors
component:
{
"warnings": [
{
"errorId": long,
"domain": "string",
"subDomain": "string",
"category": "ErrorCategory",
"message": "string",
"longMessage": "string",
"inputRefIds": ["string"],
"outputRefIds": ["string"],
"parameters": [ErrorParameter]
}
],
"resource": "Hello, eBay followers!"
}
Note that because warnings do not stop processing, the HTTP status code returns as
200
.
An error response
Here is an
errors
response component with no
warnings
component:
{
"errors": [
{
"errorId": long,
"domain": "string",
"subDomain": "string",
"category": "ErrorCategory",
"message": "string",
"longMessage": "string",
"inputRefIds": ["string"],
"outputRefIds": ["string"],
"parameters": [ErrorParameter]
}
]
}
A response without errors or warnings
And finally, here's a response without either an
errors
or
warnings
component:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
"resource": "Hello, eBay follower!!"
}
Error and warning response field values
The following table describes the fields that can be returned in an
errors
or
warnings
container:
API error and warning fields
Field
Type

category
ErrorCategory
The category type for this error or warning. It takes an
ErrorCategory
object which can have one of three values:
APPLICATION
: Indicates an exception or error occurred in the application code or at runtime. Examples include catching an exception in a service's business logic, system failures, or request errors
from a dependency.
BUSINESS
: Used when your service or a dependent service refused to continue processing on the resource because of a business rule violation such as "Seller does not ship item to Antarctica"
or "Buyer ineligible to purchase an alcoholic item". Business errors are not syntactical input errors.
REQUEST
: Used when there is anything wrong with the request, such as; authentication, syntactical errors, rate limiting or missing headers, bad HTTP header values, and so on.
errorData.
domain
string
Name of the domain containing the service or application.
errorData.
errorId
number
(long)
A positive integer that uniquely identifies the specific error condition that occurred. Your application can use error codes as identifiers in your customized error-handling algorithms.
errorData.
inputRefIds
string
Identifies specific request elements associated with the error, if any.
inputRefId
's response is format specific. For JSON, use
JSONPath
notation.
errorData.
longMessage
string
An expanded version of
message
that should be around 100-200 characters long, but is not required to be such.
errorData.
message

long. If applicable, the value is localized in the end user's requested locale.
errorData.
outputRefIds
string
Identifies specific response elements associated with the error, if any. Path format is the same as
inputRefId
.
errorData.
parameters
ErrorParameter
This optional complex field type contains a list of one or more context-specific
ErrorParameter
objects, with each item in the list entry being a parameter (or input field name) that caused an error condition. Each
ErrorPrameter
objects consist of two fields, a
name
and a
value
.
errorData.parameters.
name
string
This is the name of the parameter/field for which the error was thrown.
errorData.parameters.
value
string
This is the value of the parameter/field for which the error was thrown.
errorData.
subDomain
string
Name of the domain’s subsystem or subdivision. For example,
checkout
is a subdomain in the
buying
domain.
An example error response
The following error shows a sample response if there is a problem with one of the parameters passed into the call:
{
"errors": [
{
"errorId": 15008,
"domain": "API_ORDER",
"category": "REQUEST",
"message": "Invalid Field : itemId.",
"inputRefIds": [
"$.lineItemInputs[0].itemId"
],
"parameters": [
{
"name": "itemId",
"value": "
v1|2*********|0
"
}
]
}
]
}
Common errors
When you make a call to an eBay API, you can get a response that contains errors or warnings as described above. However, each API can also return
common errors
, which are error conditions that can occur while processing a call to any API. Common errors stop processing and they must be addressed before you can get a successful response
from your call.
The common errors use the same error response structure that the individual interfaces use:
{
"errors": [
{
"errorId": long,
"domain": "string",
"subDomain": "string",
"category": "ErrorCategory",
"message": "string",
"longMessage": "string",
"inputRefIds": ["string"],
"outputRefIds": ["string"],
"parameters": [ErrorParameter]
}
]
}

Versioning and the API lifecycle
Each API travels through the
API lifecycle
, where it goes through the different stages of release, updates, and eventually deprecation.
API versioning
API launch stages
Limited Release APIs
Experimental APIs
eBay deprecation policy
API versioning
The eBay RESTful APIs have three part version numbers, where each part is separated by periods ("."). For example, version 1.0.0 designates the first release of an API, and later
releases of the API will update one or more of the version-number parts. Despite the similarity to decimal points, any or all three of the version-number parts can be greater than 9.
For example, 1.12.47 is a valid version number.
The three version-number parts are defined as the major.minor.maintenance versions of a release, where each version-number part represents a different type of change in the API.
With this, you can interpret an API at Version 1.3.7 as being at major version 1, minor version 3, and maintenance version 7.
To illustrate how you should handle new versions of an API, the following list outlines a series of updates that start with Version 1.3.7:
Version 1.3.8
increments the third version number. This is a
maintenance release
of backwards-compatible bug fixes, or similar updates, that were applied to the previous version (Version 1.3.7).
This change should have no effect on you other than noticing that the version has been updated. You do not need to make any changes to your code.
Version 1.4.0
increments the
minor release
number. This represents new, backwards-compatible functionality applied to Version 1.3.8.
The API now has additional response fields, new optional parameters, new commands, or something similar. You can continue using the API with your existing code, but you should
update it to make use of the
API's new feature(s)
.
Version 2.0.0
is a
major release
. The major release number is incremented, and the other version numbers are zeroed out. Major version releases include
backwards-incompatible
API changes from the previous release of the API.
The API has deprecated a method, added a new required parameter, etc. You should update your code, including your API call URIs, so it works with the new version. However, you
can continue to use the old version with no code changes, at least for a while (see below for eBay's version deprecation policies).
Major version changes require a change in the URIs you use to make calls to that API. As discussed in
REST operation URIs
, the URI in the operation includes the API's major version number.
API launch stages
eBay has three stages of release for APIs and developer products:
Alpha
,
Beta
, and
General Availability
(GA). In addition to release stages, an API can also have
Experimental
releases. Experimental is not a release phase in the same sense as Alpha, Beta, and GA; it does not represent a maturity model and can occur at any of the three release stages.
This table summarizes the purpose and usage of each type of release:
Characteristic
Launch Stage
Alpha
Beta
General Availability (GA)
Purpose and benefit
Purpose is to test and develop API features and functionality requirements. Opportunity to preview and influence future eBay API features.
Purpose is to release API capabilities for feedback. Opportunity to get early access to new APIs before GA.

Limited Release APIs
Some eBay RESTful public APIs or specific API methods are not available to all developers. These capabilities are designated as
Limited Release
. eBay restricts access to these APIs and methods to developers/applications that provide the most value to eBay, eBay buyers and sellers, and the eBay developer community.
Access to Limited Release APIs is contingent upon invitation from eBay and/or a rigorous business case review and signed contracts.
Note:
Limited Release is not a release phase, such as Beta or GA, which implies API maturity. However, the release phases apply to Limited Release APIs. That is, a Limited Release API
may be in any release phase, such as Experimental or GA.
As with all of the RESTful public APIs, access is controlled through scopes. Once an application has been approved to use a Limited Release API, the required scopes will be made
available, allowing access tokens to be generated with the necessary permissions.
Refer to the documentation of the API to learn if or how you can get access.
Experimental APIs
The purpose of eBay’s
experimental
APIs is testing and research. eBay uses experimental releases to test new business capabilities or features and analyze impact. Experimental APIs are not tied to release phases and
eBay has no commitment to refine or deliver to full maturity (i.e., GA release). Experimental may apply to a complete API, an individual resource, or a method. An experimental
resource or method can be added to (or removed from) an API at any of the three launch phases.
Note:
Experimental does not imply low quality, lack of support, or poor performance. Experimental is not a release phase, such as Beta or GA, which implies API maturity. However,
changes to an experimental API may not be backward compatible and can occur at any time. API or interfaces may be removed with little notice. Use at your own risk. Experimental
APIs are suitable for limited production use, but not for business critical use.
Experimental API access could be subject to eligibility criteria. Refer to the API documentation for more information.
eBay deprecation policy
Although eBay strives to make updates to its APIs compatible with all previous versions, there are times when an API becomes outdated and eBay must deprecate the API in order to
provide a better service to its customers. The API endpoints will continue to be available during the deprecation period. The deprecation details are documented on the
API deprecation status
page.

The Buy APIs let you create buying experiences outside of the eBay.com site. Users can search for, select, and purchase eBay items. Sellers can mirror and curate the contents of
the items in an eBay category, provide marketing information to buyers to encourage conversion, and track their orders, all from within your own site. The following are the Buy APIs:
Browse API
:
Search for and retrieve eBay items and use filters and parameters to create customized item sets. Search by image ID (a Base64 string) and check if a product is compatible with the
specified item, such as if a specific car is compatible with a specific part or search for a compatible part. It also provides the ability for eBay members to add and remove items and
change the quantity of an item in their eBay shopping cart as well as view the contents of their eBay cart.
Deal API
:
Search for and retrieve details about eBay deals and events, as well as the items associated with those deals and events.
Feed API
:
Download daily files containing newly listed items or weekly bootstrap files containing all the items in a category. Download an hourly file of items that have changed in a category
during that hour.
Marketing API
:
Retrieve products based on category and metric, such as best selling, and 'also viewed" and 'also bought' products based on a product.
Marketplace Insights API
:
Retrieve the sales history of items sold on eBay. (This is a
Limited Release
.)
Offer API
:
Place bids for a buyer on auction items and retrieve the bidding details for an auction where the buyer has placed a bid.
Order API
:
Open a guest checkout session, update orders, apply a coupon to the order, retrieve order, payment status, and shipment details, and pay for the order. For eBay member checkouts,
it also provides legacy IDs to enable you to use the
Post Order API
for returns and cancellations.
Note:
You can also use the Commerce
Taxonomy API
to discover and use appropriate categories to filter items retrieved by the Buy APIs.
The Buy APIs listed above are intended for certain approved eBay partners based on their application. Acceptance of applications is based on the proposed business model, as well
as a formal agreement to abide by the policies and requirements stipulated by eBay.
Complete these primary steps to request access to eBay’s Buy APIs:
Note:
Some steps might not apply to your integration.
Step 1: Ensure you have an eBay Developer account
Step 2: Ensure you meet the Buy API minimum requirements and agreements
Step 3: Integrate with eBay APIs and test your application in Sandbox
Step 4: Apply for an Application Growth Check to get access to Buy APIs in Production
Step 5: Go live in the Production environment
Step 1: Ensure you have an eBay Developer account
You must have an
eBay Developer account
and be familiar with the material and complete developer account procedures in the
Get Started with eBay APIs Guide
.
Step 2: Ensure you meet the Buy API minimum requirements and agreements
Depending on your use case, your application must meet
requirements
defined by eBay. Buy API integrations can fall into one of the below categories:
eBay Affiliate
eBay member checkout (Order API)
eBay guest checkouts (APIs and “Checkout with eBay” widget)
Access to Offer API
eBay Affiliate
eBay Affiliate and eBay guest checkouts (Checkout with eBay) need to be a member of the
eBay Partner Network
.
eBay guest checkout (APIs and “Checkout with eBay” widget)
Both eBay Affiliate and eBay guest checkouts (Checkout with eBay) need to be a member of the
eBay Partner Network
.
If your business model is approved by eBay Partner Network, you will be informed on the next steps. Please take a look at the minimum
production eligibility requirements
for guest checkout for more details.
eBay member checkout (Order API)
To obtain eBay member checkout access, your business use case should be approved by eBay. This approval will give you access for member checkout in both the Sandbox and
Production API environments. Member checkout requires you to be an eBay member.
Complete these steps to request Production access. Within this process, you will:
Align with the Business Unit on the Partnership and the integration model.
Present your use case and the APIs you would like to use.
Be approved to use the member checkout use case by eBay.
Partners should have a domestic company and warehouse located in the eBay marketplace they want to buy from.
Please take a look at the minimum
production eligibility requirements
for more details. This includes the
eBay User Agreement
,
Privacy Policy
and
API License Agreement
.
Access to Offer API
Offer API allows you to place bids on auction listings as an eBay member. To obtain access to this API in Production, your business use case should be approved by eBay.
Complete these steps to request Production access. Within this process, you will:
File a support ticket via your developer account with your use case and the APIs you would like to use. Make sure to include all relevant information about your application like the
eBay marketplaces and the user base.
You will be asked to present the end to end flow of your application in Sandbox.
On approval, you will be granted access to Offer API in Production.
Step 3: Integrate with eBay APIs and test your application in Sandbox
At this point in the process, you should be able to integrate and test your application within the Sandbox environment with the exception of the methods for accessing member
checkout APIs. However, there is an additional process required to use the checkout APIs in Sandbox. Please refer to the
Production access process
for more details.
Step 4: Apply for an Application Growth Check to get access to Buy APIs in Production
The
Application Growth Check
is a mandatory step for using restricted Buy APIs in Production. This is done by the eBay team as a final step before granting Production access to the partner’s production keyset to
access Buy APIs. For more information, please refer to the
Application Growth Check process
.
Step 5: Go live in the Production environment
You can go live with your application once all approvals and contracts are in place.

React Widgets
eBay makes available components for React applications to provide functionality to find eBay item listings and translate item titles and descriptions. These widgets are lightweight,
responsive and fully customizable.
eBay Items Widget
The eBay Items widget surfaces a rich selection of items for buyers. The widget provides a responsive UI experience with four different layouts:
Single Item Carousel
: View for presenting data in a horizontally scrollable layout. You can swipe to move through a collection of items
Multiple Items Carousel
: Similar to carousel view with three items per carousel slide
List
: Displays the items in a list
Gallery
: Displays the items organized in a responsive layout
The Items widget is available here:
https://github.com/eBay/ebay-items-react-widget (https://github.com/eBay/ebay-items-react-widget)
Note:
The item search is powered by
eBay Browse API
.
eBay Translation Widget
The eBay Translation widget translates eBay item titles and descriptions to another language. The widget provides a responsive UI experience with two different modes:
Translation by Text
: Simply enter the item title/description in the textbox, set the translation context and click Translate
Translation by listing/item ID
: This mode uses
eBay Browse API
to fetch the item title and description and then uses
eBay Translation API
to do the translation
It comes with a ready to use
example
and a
NodeJS express server
to bootstrap integration with
eBay Translation API
.
The Translation widget is available here:

Authentication information for the user on whose behalf the
application is making the request. Only registered eBay users are
allowed to make API calls. To verify that a user is registered,
your application needs to pass a user-specific value called an
"authentication token" in the request. This is equivalent to
signing in on the eBay Web site. As API calls do not pass session
information, you need to pass the user's authentication token every
time you invoke a call on their behalf. All calls require an
authentication token, except the calls you use to retrieve a token
in the first place. (For such calls, you use the eBay member's
username and password instead.)
Yes
This call allows a seller to create and publish a fixed-price listing.
The main difference between <b>AddFixedPriceItem</b> and <b>AddItem</b> is that
<b>AddFixedPriceItem</b> supports the creation of fixed-price listings only,
whereas <b>AddItem</b> supports all listing formats.
<br>
<br>
Also, only <b>AddFixedPriceItem</b> supports multiple-variation listings
and tracking inventory by a seller-defined SKU value. <b>AddItem</b> does not support
Variations or the <b>InventoryTrackingMethod</b> field.

<br>
A SKU (stock keeping unit) is an identifier defined by a seller.
Some sellers use SKUs to track complex flows of products
and information on the client side.
eBay preserves the SKU on the item, enabling you
to obtain it before and after an order line item is created.
(SKU is recommended as an alternative to
ApplicationData.)<br>
<br>
In <b>GetItem</b>, <b>SKU</b> can only be used to retrieve one of your

If many orders are available to retrieve, you may need to call GetOrders multiple times to retrieve all the data. Each result set is returned as a page of orders. Use the Pagination

The ModTimeFrom and ModTimeTo fields specify a date range for retrieving existing orders that have been modified within this time period (for example, Incomplete status to
Pending status or Pending status to Complete status). The ModTimeFrom field is the starting date range. All eBay orders that were last modified within this date range are
returned in the output. Unlike the CreateTimeFrom/CreateTimeTo filters, which may cover a maximum period of 90 days, the maximum date range that may be specified with the
ModTimeFrom and ModTimeTo fields is only 30 days. This value cannot be set back more than 90 days in the past, as this call cannot retrieve sales older than 90 days old.
ModTimeFrom/ModTimeTo date filters are ignored if the CreateTimeFrom/CreateTimeTo or NumberOfDays date filters are used in the request, or if one or more order IDs are

The Item container is used to configure the item that will be relisted. If the seller plans to relist the item with no changes, the only field under the Item container that is required is the
ItemID field. In the ItemID field, the seller specifies the item that will be relisted. If the seller wishes to change anything else for the listing, the seller should include this field in the call

Base type definition of the request payload, which can carry any type of payload
content plus optional versioning information and detail level requirements. All
concrete request types (e.g., AddItemRequestType) are derived from the abstract
request type. The naming convention we use for the concrete type names is the name
of the service (the verb or call name) followed by "RequestType":
VerbNameRequestType
Detail levels are instructions that define standard subsets of
data to return for particular data components (e.g., each
Item, Transaction, or User) within the response payload.
For example, a particular detail level might cause the
response to include buyer-related data in every result
(e.g., for every Item), but no seller-related data.
<br/><br/>
Specifying a detail level is like using a
predefined attribute list in the SELECT clause of an SQL query.
Use the <b>DetailLevel</b> element to specify the required detail level
that the client application needs pertaining to the data components
that are applicable to the request.
<br><br>
The <b>DetailLevelCodeType</b> defines the
global list of available detail levels for all request types.
Most request types support certain detail
levels or none at all. If you pass a detail level that exists
in the schema but that isn't valid for a particular request,
eBay ignores it and processes the request without it.
<br/><br/>
For each request type, see the detail level tables in the
Input/Output Reference to determine which detail levels are
applicable and which elements are returned for each applicable
detail level.
<br><br>Note that <b>DetailLevel</b> is required input for
<b>GetMyMessages</b>. <br>
<br>
With <b>GetSellerList</b> and other calls that retrieve large data sets,
please avoid using <b>ReturnAll</b> when possible. For example, if you use
<b>GetSellerList</b>, use <b>GranularityLevel</b> instead, or use <b>GetSellerEvents</b>. If
<b>GetSellerList</b>, use a small <b>Pagination.EntriesPerPage</b> value and a narrow
<b>EndTimeFrom</b>/<b>EndTimeTo</b> date range for better performance.

Most Trading API calls support a MessageID element in the request
and a <b>CorrelationID</b> element in the response. If you pass in a
<b>MessageID</b> in a request, the same value will be returned in the
<b>CorrelationID</b> field in the response. Pairing these values can
help you track and confirm that a response is returned for every request and to
match specific responses to specific requests.
If you do not pass a <b>MessageID</b> value in the request,
<b>CorrelationID</b> is not returned.<br>
<br>
<span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
<b>GetCategories</b> is designed to retrieve very large sets of metadata
that change once a day or less often. To improve performance, these calls return
cached responses when you request all available data (with no filters). When this

aren't applicable. However, if you specify an input filter to reduce the amount of

The version number of the API code that you are
programming against (e.g., 1149).
The version you specify for a call has these basic effects:
<b></b>
<ul>
<li>It indicates the version of the code lists and other
data that eBay should use to process your request.</li>
<li>It indicates the schema version you are using.</li>
</ul>
You need to use a version that is greater than or equal to the
lowest supported version.

<b>For the SOAP API:</b> If you are using the SOAP API,
this field is required. Specify the version of the WSDL your
application is using.<br>
<br>
<b>For the XML API:</b> If you are using the XML API,
this field has no effect. Instead, specify the version in the
<b>X-EBAY-API-COMPATIBILITY-LEVEL</b> HTTP header.
(If you specify <b>Version</b> in the body of an XML API request and it
is different from the value in the HTTP header, eBay returns an
informational warning that the value in the HTTP header was used
instead.)

You can use the OutputSelector field to restrict the data returned by a call. This field can make the call response easier to manage, especially when a large payload is returned. If
you use the OutputSelector field, the output data will only include the field(s) you specified in the request, as well as all of its child fields (if a field is a container) and its parent fields
(if any). Note that it is possible that a field included through an OutputSelector field may still not be returned if it is not applicable, or if it is not found based on other criteria set up in

OutputSelector
Controls whether or not to return warnings when the application passes
unrecognized or deprecated elements in a request.<br>
<br>
An unrecognized element is one that is not defined in any supported
version of the schema. Schema element names are case-sensitive,
so using <b>WarningLevel</b> can also help you remove any potential hidden
bugs within your application due to incorrect case or spelling in
field names before you put your application into the
Production environment.<br>
<br>
<b>WarningLevel</b> only validates elements; it doesn't validate
XML attributes. It also doesn't control warnings related to
user-entered strings or numbers, or warnings for
logical errors.<br>

We recommend that you only use this during development and debugging.
Do not use this in requests performed in the Production environment.

This container is only used by the PlaceOffer call request if the previous PlaceOffer call resulted in a BotBlock container in the response. If the caller receives this container in the
response, that caller must make another PlaceOffer call, this time, passing in the encrypted token and URL that is returned in the BotBlock container in the response. This
safeguard lets eBay know that a real user is making a PlaceOffer call and not a bot.

Security header used for SOAP API calls.
Authentication token representing the user who is making the
request. The user's token must be retrieved from eBay. To determine
a user's authentication token, see the Authentication and
Authorization information in the eBay Web Services guide. For calls
that list or retrieve item or transaction data, the user usually
needs to be the seller of the item in question or, in some cases,
the buyer. Similarly, calls that retrieve user or account data may
be restricted to the user whose data is being requested. The
documentation for each call includes information about such
restrictions.

Expiration date of the user's authentication token. Only returned
within the 7-day period prior to a token's expiration. To ensure
that user authentication tokens are secure and to help avoid a
user's token being compromised, tokens have a limited life span. A
token is only valid for a period of time (set by eBay). After this
amount of time has passed, the token expires and must be replaced
with a new token.
GetSessionID,FetchToken
Conditionally
Authentication information for the user on whose behalf the
application is making the request, and authorization information for
the application making the request. Only registered eBay users are
allowed to make API calls. To verify that a user is registered, your
application normally needs to pass a user-specific value called an
"authentication token" in the request. This is equivalent to signing
in on the eBay Web site. As API calls do not pass session
information, you need to pass the user's authentication token every
time you invoke a call on their behalf. All calls require an
authentication token, except the calls you use to retrieve a token
in the first place. For such calls, you use the eBay member's
username and password instead.

Specifies standard subsets of data to return for each result
within the set of results in the response payload. If no
detail level is specified, a base set of data is returned.
The base set of data varies per call.
Returns all available data.
With <b>GetSellerList</b> and other calls that retrieve large data sets,
please avoid using <b>ReturnAll</b> when possible. For example, if you use
<b>GetSellerList</b>, use a <b>GranularityLevel</b> or use the
<b>GetSellerEvents</b> call instead. If you use <b>ReturnAll</b> with <b>GetSellerList</b>,
use a small <b>EntriesPerPage</b> value and a short
<b>EndTimeFrom</b>/<b>EndTimeTo</b> range for better performance.

For <b>GetMyMessages</b>, this detail level returns the same data
whether or not you include <b>MessageIDs</b> in the

Currently, this detail level is the only way to retrieve
<b>FolderID</b> and <b>FolderName</b> values. See <b>GetMyMessages</b>

this.
Returns message headers.
For <b>GetMyMessages</b>, if you include <b>MessageIDs</b> in
the request, this detail level returns header information,
without body text, for the specified message ID or alert ID
values. If you include a <b>FolderID</b>, header information is
returned only for the messages and alerts in the specified
folder.<br/><br/>
If you do not include <b>MessageIDs</b>, this detail
level returns header information for Alerts and Messages as follows:

<li>If all the Alerts have been read, they are sorted in date order,
with the most recent first.</li>
<li>If one of the Alerts has not been read, the Read Alerts come first,

An error has occurred either as a result of a problem in the sending
application or because the application's end-user has attempted to submit
invalid data (or missing data). In these cases, do not retry the request. The
problem must be corrected before the request can be made again. If the problem
is due to something in the application (such as a missing required field), the
application must be changed. If the problem is a result of end-user data, the
application must alert the end-user to the problem and provide the means for
the end-user to correct the data. Once the problem in the application or data
is resolved, resend the request to eBay with the corrected data.
Indicates that an error has occurred on the eBay system side, such as a
database or server down. An application can retry the request as-is a
reasonable number of times (eBay recommends twice). If the error persists,
contact Developer Technical Support. Once the problem has been resolved, the
request may be resent in its original form.
(out) Reserved for internal or future use.
Preferences that specify how eBay should handle certain requests that contain
invalid data or that could partially fail. These preferences give you some control
over whether eBay returns warnings or errors in response to invalid data and how
eBay handles listing requests when such data is passed in. For example, these
preferences are applicable to <b>AddItem</b> and related calls when Item Specifics are
specified, and to <b>CompleteSale</b>. See <a href="https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/user-guides/static/ma
for details about these preferences and their effects.
Apply validation rules that were in effect prior to the time
the call started supporting <b>ErrorHandling</b>.
Drop the invalid data, continue processing the request with the
valid data. If dropping the invalid data leaves the request in a
state where required data is missing, reject the request.<br>
<br>
If <b>BestEffort</b> is specified for <b>CompleteSale</b>, the Ack field in the
response could return PartialFailure if one change fails but
another succeeds. For example, if the seller attempts to
leave feedback twice for the same order line item, the feedback changes
would fail but any paid or shipped status changes would succeed.
If any of the item specifics data is invalid, drop all the data and
proceed with listing the item. If the category has required item specifics
and the data was dropped, reject the listing.
If any data is invalid, reject the request.
This type is used by the ErrorParameters container if one or more errors or warnings occur with the call, and if a specific request parameter has been pinpointed as the reason why
the error or warning was triggered.
This is the value of the request parameter noted in the ParamID attribute. So, if the ParamID value was ItemID, the value in this field would be the actual value of that ItemID.
Conditionally
This is name of the request parameter that has been pinpointed as the reason why the error or warning was triggered. This value might be ItemID, in which case the identifier of that
item would be returned in the Value field.

Basic type for specifying measures and the system of measurement.
A decimal value (e.g., 10.25) is meaningful
as a measure when accompanied by a definition of the unit of measure (e.g., Pounds),
in which case the value specifies the quantity of that unit.
A MeasureType expresses both the value (a decimal) and, optionally, the unit and
the system of measurement.
Details such as shipping weights are specified as measure types.
Unit of measure. This attribute is shared by various fields,
representing units such as lbs, oz, kg, g, in, cm.

SeverityCodeType - Type declaration to be used by other schema.
This code identifies the severity of an API error. A code indicates
whether there is an API-level error or warning that needs to be
communicated to the client.
The request was processed successfully, but something occurred that may affect your application or the user. For example, eBay may have changed a value the user sent in. In this
case, eBay returns a normal, successful response and also returns the warning.

This enumerated type contains the list of values that can be passed in through the WarningLevel field of a call request.
The WarningLevel value is set to Low if the user does not wish to receive warnings when the application passes
unrecognized or deprecated elements in an API call request.
This is the default value if <b>WarningLevel</b> is not specified in the call request.
The WarningLevel value is set to High if the user wishes to receive warnings when the application passes unrecognized or deprecated elements in an API call request. Setting the
WarningLevel value to High is not recommended in a production environment. Instead, it should only be used during the development/debugging stage.
eBay user ID (i.e., eBay.com Web site login name) for the user the application
is retrieving a token for. This is typically the application's end-user (not
the developer).

Authentication token representing the user who is making the request. The
user's token must be retrieved from eBay. To determine a user's authentication
token, see the Authentication and Authorization information in the eBay Web
Services guide. For calls that list or retrieve item or transaction data, the
user usually needs to be the seller of the item in question or, in some cases,
the buyer. Similarly, calls that retrieve user or account data may be

An eBay-defined complex type for specifying monetary amounts.

A double value (e.g., 1.00 or 1.0) is meaningful as a monetary amount when accompanied by a specification of
<br><br>
The <b>AmountType</b> data type is typically used to specify details such as prices, fees, costs, and payment
<br><br>
Because a double is used to represent the amount, this also means whole monetary amounts may be returned with
Three-digit code representing the currency type being used.
<br>
In <b>Add</b>/<b>Revise</b>/<b>Relist</b> calls, the currency can be specified in
the <b>Item.Currency</b> field in requests instead.
If you do specify this attribute in <b>Add</b>/<b>Revise</b>/<b>Relist</b> calls,
the value must match the site currency (i.e., it must be the same
as the value in <b>Item.Currency</b>) unless otherwise stated.<br>
<br>
In <b>Add</b>/<b>Revise</b>/<b>Relist</b> calls, listing fees are returned in the
currency of the user's registration site.
For example, a user who is registered on the eBay US site always
sees their fees returned in USD, even when their listing request
is sent to another site, such as eBay UK or eBay Germany.

Some eBay sites may select a few categories and designate them as
"value categories". These are typically selected from
categories where buyers can find great deals. (Not all categories
with great deals are designated as value categories.)
This designation can change over time. <br/>
<br/>
While a category is designated as a value category (i.e.,
when <b>ValueCategory</b> is <code>true</code>), it is subject to the following rule:
Items in value categories can only be listed in one category.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you attempt to list in two categories and the
primary category or secondary category is a value category,
then eBay drops the secondary category and lists the
item in the primary category only.
Similarly, if you attempt to add a secondary category to an existing
listing, or you change the category for an existing listing,
and if the primary or secondary category is a value category,
then eBay drops the secondary category.

This enumerated type is used by the seller to set the shipping discount type. Some of these shipping discount types apply to flat-rate shipping and others apply to calculated shipping.
The cost to ship each item beyond the first item (where the item with the
highest shipping cost is selected by eBay as the first item).
Let's say the buyer purchases three items, each set to ship for $8, and
the seller set EachAdditionalAmount to $6. The cost to ship three items would
normally be $24, but since the seller specified $6, the total shipping
cost would be $8 + $6 + $6, or $20.
For flat shipping discount profile only.
The amount by which to reduce the cost to ship each item beyond the
first item (where the item with the highest shipping cost is selected by eBay
as the first item).
Let's say the buyer purchases three items, each set to ship for $8, and
the seller set EachAdditionalAmountOff to $2. The cost to ship three items would
normally be $24, but since the seller specified $2, the total shipping
cost would be $24 - (two additional items x $2), or $20.
For flat shipping discount profile only.
The percentage by which to reduce the cost to ship each item beyond
the first item (where the item with the highest shipping cost is selected by
eBay as the first item).
Let's say the buyer purchases three items, each set to ship for $8, and
the seller set EachAdditionalPercentOff to 0.25. The cost to ship three items would
normally be $24, but since the seller specified 0.25 ($2 out of 8), the total shipping
cost would be $24 - (two additional items x $2), or $20.
For flat rate shipping discount profile only.
Shipping cost is the total of what it would cost to ship each item individually.
This is simply a way to define how shipping is to be calculated--there is no
discount for the buyer with this selection.
For calculated shipping discount profile only.
Shipping cost is based on the total weight of all individual items.
This is simply a way to define how shipping is to be calculated--there is no
discount for the buyer with this selection.
For calculated shipping discount profile only.
The amount of weight to subtract for each item beyond the first item
before shipping costs are calculated. For example, there may be less packing
material when the items are combined in one box than if they were shipped
individually. Let's say the buyer purchases three items, each 10 oz. in weight, and
the seller set WeightOff to 2 oz. The combined weight would be 30 oz., but since
the seller specified 2 oz. off, the total weight for shipping cost calculation
would be 30 oz. - (two additional items x 2 oz.), or 26 oz.

If a shipping service has been specified (even LocalPickup), <b>GetItem</b> returns
the shipping service cost, even if the cost is zero. Otherwise, cost is not
returned.
<br>
<br>
If this is for calculated shipping for a listing that has not
yet ended, note that the cost cannot be determined until the listing
has ended and the buyer has specified a postal code.
<br>
<br>
For <b>GetItemShipping</b>, promotional shipping savings is reflected in the cost, if
applicable. If the promotional shipping option is lower than other shipping
services being offered, the savings is reflected in the returned shipping
cost.
The shipping service named Promotional Shipping Service (or whatever is
the localized name for it) is included among the shipping services.
If the promotional shipping cost is lower than the cost of other shipping
services being offered, it is presented first in the list. (The LOWEST shipping
service cost is always presented first, regardless of whether there is
promotional shipping.)

Parts Compatibility is not supported for the given category.
Parts Compatibility may be entered by application only for the given category.
Entering parts compatibility by application specifies the assemblies (e.g., a
specific year, make, and model of car) to which the item applies. Parts
compatibility by application can be specified by listing with a catalog
product that supports parts compatibility or by specifying parts compatibility
by application manually (<b> Item.ItemCompatibilityList</b>).
Parts Compatibility may be entered by specification only for the given
category. Entering parts compatibility by specification involves specifying
the part's relevant dimensions or characteristics (e.g., Section Width, Aspect
Ratio, Rim Diammeter, Load Index, and Speed Rating values for a tire) using
attributes.

Defines the parts compatibility feature. If the field is present, the
corresponding feature applies to the site. The field is returned as an empty
element (e.g., a boolean value is not returned).
<br><br>
Parts compatibility listings contain information to determine the assemblies with
which a part is compatible. For example, an automotive part or accessory listed
witih parts compatibility can be matched with vehicles (e.g., specific years,
makes, and models) with which the part or accessory can be used.
<br><br>
There are two ways to enter parts compatibility: by application and by
specification.
<ul>
<li> Entering parts compatibility by application specifies the assemblies
(e.g., a specific year, make, and model of car) to which the item applies. This
can be done automatically by listing with a catalog product that supports parts
compatibility, or manually, using <b
class="con">Item.ItemCompatibilityList</b> when listing or revising an
item. </li>
<li>Entering parts compatibility by specification involves specifying the
part's relevant dimensions and characteristics necessary to determine the
assemblies with which the part is compatible (e.g., Section Width, Aspect Ratio,
Rim Diammeter, Load Index, and Speed Rating values for a tire) using
attributes.</li>
</ul>
A list of compatible applications specified as name and value pairs. Describes an
assembly with which a part is compatible (i.e., parts compatibility by application). For
example, to specify a part's compatibility with a vehicle, the name would map to
standard vehicle characteristics (e.g., Year, Make, Model, Trim, and Engine). The
values would describe the specific vehicle, such as a 2006 Honda Accord.

This container is used to provide one or more product identifiers for a product, and if desired by the seller, eBay will use the identifier(s) of the product to try to

product will be prefilled for the listing. Product details defined for a catalog product include the product title, product description, product aspects, and stock

For AddItem family of calls: The Quantity value for auction listings must always be 1. For a fixed-price listing, the Quantity value indicates the number of identical
items the seller has available for sale in the listing. If this field is not included when creating a new fixed-price listing, quantity defaults to '1'. If variations are
specified in AddFixedPriceItem or VerifyAddFixedPriceItem, the Item.Quantity is not required since the quantity of variations is specified in Variation.Quantity
instead. See the Creating a listing with variations (https://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/listing-variations.html) eBay Help page for more information on variations.
<br><br>
<b>For ReviseItem and ReviseFixedPriceItem:</b>
This value can only be changed for a fixed-price listing with no variations. The
quantity of variations is controlled in the <b>Variation.Quantity</b> field and the <b>
value for an auction listing should always be <code>1</code>.
<br><br>
<b>For RelistItem and RelistFixedPriceItem:</b>
Like most fields, when you use <b>RelistItem</b> or <b>RelistFixedPriceItem</b>,
<b>Quantity</b> retains its original value unless you specifically change
it. This means that the item is relisted with the value that was
already in <b>Quantity</b>, not with the remaining quantity available.
For example, if the original <b>Quantity</b> value was <code>10</code>, and three items
eBay sets the relisted item's <b>Quantity</b> to <code>10</code> by default, and not <c
So, we strongly recommend that you always
set <b>Quantity</b> to the correct value (your actual quantity available)
in your relist requests.<br>
<br>
When eBay auto-renews a GTC listing (<b>ListingDuration</b> = <b>GTC</b>)
on your behalf, eBay relists with correct quantity available.
<br>
<br>
<b>For GetSellerEvents:</b> <b>Quantity</b> is only returned
for listings where item quantity is greater than 1.
<br><br>
<b>For GetItem and related calls:</b>
This is the total of the number of items available for sale plus the quantity
already sold. To determine the number of items available, subtract
<b>SellingStatus.QuantitySold</b> from this value.
<br><br>
<b>For order line item calls with variations:</b>
In <b>GetItemTransactions</b>, <b>Item.Quantity</b> is the same as <b>GetItem</b> (the
total quantity across all variations). In <b>GetSellerTransactions</b>,
<b>Transaction.Item.Quantity</b> is the total quantity of the applicable
variation (quantity available plus quantity sold).

The unique identifier for a secondary category. This field is only applicable if the seller decides to list the item under two categories.
<br>
<br>
You cannot list US eBay Motors vehicles in two categories. However, you can
list Parts & Accessories in two categories. The final value fee is based
on the primary category in which the item is listed. Furthermore, you can
list the same item in an eBay Motors Parts & Accessories category and in
an eligible eBay category, as long as the primary category is associated
with the site on which you are listing. That is, the two categories can be a
mix of Motors Parts & Accessories and eBay site categories. (Real
Estate, Mature Audience (adult), and Business & Industrial categories
are not eligible for listing in two categories in this manner.) For example,
if you list on Motors, the primary category could be 6750 (eBay Motors >
Parts & Accessories > Apparel & Merchandise > Motorcycle >
Jackets & Leathers), and the secondary category could be 57988 (eBay
> Clothing, Shoes > Accessories > Men's Clothing > Outerwear).
If you list on the main eBay site, the primary category could be 57988 and

GeteBayDetails
The name of the eBay listing site. The listing site affects
the business logic and validation rules that are applied to the request,
which in turn affect the values that are returned in the response, as well
as values that appear on the eBay site. For example, the listing site
can affect the validation of <b>Category</b> in listing requests, international
business seller requirements, the values of converted (localized) prices in
responses, the item-related time stamps that are displayed on the eBay site, the visibi
<b>GetCategoryListings</b>), and other information. In some cases, the rules are
determined by a combination of the site, the user's registration address,
and other information. You cannot change the site when you revise a
listing.<br>
<br>
When you specify <b>Item.Site</b> in <b>AddItem</b> or <b>AddFixedPriceItem</b>, it mus
numeric site ID that you specify in the request URL (for the SOAP API) or
the <b>X-EBAY-API-SITEID</b> header (for the XML API).

A SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) value is a seller-defined identifier for a product. Each product within a seller's inventory should be unique. Most large-volume sellers
use SKUs, but eBay only requires a SKU value if the InventoryTrackingMethod field is included in an AddFixedPriceItem call and its value is set to SKU. Setting the
InventoryTrackingMethod field to SKU allows the seller to use a SKU value instead of an ItemID value as a unique identifier
in calls such as <b>GetItem</b> and <b>ReviseInventoryStatus</b>
<br><br>
A seller can specify a SKU when listing an item with <b>AddItem</b>
and related calls. eBay preserves the SKU on the item, enabling you
to obtain it before and after an order line item is created.
(<b>SKU</b> is recommended as an alternative to <b>ApplicationData</b>.)
<br>
<br>
If both <b>ItemID</b> and <b>SKU</b> are specified in calls that support the use of
SKU as a unique identifier, the <b>ItemID</b> value takes precedence.<br>

If a seller wants to use SKUs for multiple-variation listings, the SKU value for each p

<br>
<span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b>
The eBay site cannot identify listings by SKU. For example,
My eBay pages and Search pages all identify listings by item ID.

uses the item ID as the identifier. Buyer-focused APIs (like the
Shopping API) also do not support SKU as an identifier.

This container consists of the data associated with photos within the listing. Sellers can have up to 24 pictures in almost any category at no cost. Motor vehicle

can host pictures on a non-eBay server. If pictures are externally-hosted, they must be hosted on a site that is using the 'https' protocol.

Variations are similar (but not identical) items in a
multiple-variation, fixed-price listing. For example, a T-shirt listing
could contain multiple items of the same brand
that vary by color and size (like "Blue, Large" and
"Black, Medium"). Each variation specifies a combination of one of
these colors and sizes. Each variation can have a different
quantity and price. You can buy multiple items from one
variation at the same time. (That is, one order line item can contain
multiple items from a single variation.) <br>
<br>
If you list in two categories, both categories must support
listing with variations. See <b>VariationsEnabled</b> in
<b>GetCategoryFeatures</b> to determine applicable categories.<br>
<br>
<b>For ReviseFixedPriceItem and
RelistFixedPriceItem:</b> Once a listing has been submitted with variations,
you can't delete all the variations when you revise or relist the listing (because
it would be considered a different listing). You also can't add or change variation
specifics (because they are unique identifiers). However, you can delete or replace
individual variations as needed to match your current inventory. If a variation has
no purchases, use the <b>Variation.Delete</b> field to delete the variation. If it has
inventory, set the Quantity to 0.<br>
<br>
As a best practice, if you want to revise multiple variations in
the same listing at the same time (i.e., within a very short period),
use a single <b>ReviseFixedPriceItem</b> request and include all the
variation revisions in the same request. If your application design
requires you to revise each variation individually, then avoid using
multiple parallel threads. Instead, use a serial, synchronous
process. That is, wait until each revision has been
processed by eBay before submitting the next revision request for
another variation in the same listing.<br>
<br>
<b>For GetItem and related calls</b> Only returned
when a listing has variations.
<br><br>
<b>For GetSellerList:</b> Only returned when a listing
has variations, <b>IncludeVariations</b> was set to <code>true</code> in the request,
the <b>DetailLevel</b> was set to <b>ReturnAll</b>, and an applicable pagination
value and time range were specified.<br>

<b>For GetItemTransactions</b> Only returned in Item
when a listing has variations and <b>IncludeVariations</b> was set to <code>true</code>
in the request. (Also see <b>Variation</b> returned in <b>Transaction</b> for
information about which variation was actually purchased.)

A list of parts compatibility information specified as name and value pairs.
Describes an assembly with which a part is compatible (i.e., compatibility by
application). For example, to specify a part's compatibility with a vehicle,
the name (search name) would map to standard vehicle characteristics (e.g.,
Year, Make, Model, Trim, and Engine). The values would describe the specific
vehicle, such as a 2006 Honda Accord. Use the <b>Product Metadata API</b> to
retrieve valid search names and corresponding values.
<br><br>
<b>For the <b>AddItem</b> family of calls:</b> Use this for specifying
parts compatibility by application manually. This can only be used in
categories that support parts compatibility by application. Use <b
class="con">GetCategoryFeatures</b> with the <b>CompatibilityEnabled</b>
feature ID to determine which categories support parts compatibility by
application.
<br><br>
<b>For ReviseFixedPriceItem and ReviseItem:</b> When you revise a
listing, if the listing has bids and/or ends within 12 hours, item
compatibilities cannot be deleted. You may add item compatibilities at any
time.
<br><br>
<b>For GetItem:</b> <b

seller included item compatibility in the listing and <b

Parts compatibility listings contain information to determine the assemblies with
which a part is compatible. For example, an automotive part or accessory listed
witih parts compatibility can be matched with vehicles (e.g., specific years,
makes, and models) with which the part or accessory can be used.
<br><br>
There are two ways to enter parts compatibility: by application and by
specification.
<ul>
<li> Entering parts compatibility by application specifies the assemblies
(e.g., a specific year, make, and model of car) to which the item applies. This can
be done automatically by listing with a catalog product that supports parts
compatibility, or manually, using <b
class="con">Item.ItemCompatibilityList</b> when listing or revising an
item. </li>
<li>Entering parts compatibility by specification involves specifying the
part's relevant dimensions and characteristics necessary to determine the
assemblies with which the part is compatible (e.g., Section Width, Aspect Ratio,
Rim Diammeter, Load Index, and Speed Rating values for a tire) using
attributes.</li>

be done automatically by listing with a catalog product that supports parts
compatibility, or manually, using <b
class="con">Item.ItemCompatibilityList</b> when listing or revising an
item. </li>
<li>Entering parts compatibility by specification involves specifying the

This type is used to reference a seller's specific domestic and/or international shipping rate tables. Shipping rate tables allow sellers to configure specific
shipping costs based on the shipping destinations and level of service (e.g. economy, standard, expedite, and one-day). Generally speaking, sellers want to use
these shipping rate tables so they can charge a higher shipping cost to the buyer whenever shipping costs are higher for them as well. For example, shipping to
Alaska or Hawaii is generally more expensive than shipping to any other of the 48 US states, or in regards to international shipping, shipping to some regions and
countries are more expensive than others.

A list of stock-keeping unit (SKU) identifiers that a seller uses in listings.
A SKU (stock keeping unit) is an identifier defined by a seller.
Some sellers use SKUs to track complex flows of products
and information on the client side.
A seller can specify a SKU when listing an item with AddItem
and related calls. eBay preserves the SKU on the item, enabling you
to obtain it before and after an order line item is created.
(SKU is recommended as an alternative to ApplicationData.)<br>
<br>
A SKU is not required to be unique. A seller can specify a
particular SKU value on one item or on multiple items.
Different sellers can use the same SKUs.<br>
<br>
If the SKU is unique across a seller's active listings, and if
the seller listed the item by using AddFixedPriceItem
or RelistFixedPriceItem, the seller can also set
Item.InventoryTrackingMethod to SKU. This allows the seller to use
SKU instead of ItemID as a unique identifier in subsequent calls,
such as GetItem and ReviseInventoryStatus.

This type is used to show sales tax-related details for a tax jurisdiction. The concept of 'sales tax' is only applicable to eBay US and Canada (English and French)

This float value is the sales tax percentage rate applicable to the corresponding tax jurisdiction (US state or Canadian province). Sellers are responsible for
providing accurate sales tax rates for each jurisdiction. This sales tax rate comes into play when a buyer from that tax jurisdiction makes a purchase from the
seller. The value passed in is stored with a precision of 3 digits after the decimal point (##.###).

This is the unique, two-digit identifier of the tax jurisdiction (such as 'CA' for California). To retrieve all two-digit identifiers for all states/territories/provinces for a

This container is used to provide details on a specific domestic shipping service option, including the unique identifier of the shipping service option and the
costs related to domestic shipping service. A separate ShippingServiceOptions container is needed for each domestic shipping service option that is available to
ship the item. Unless a fulfillment business policy is being used, generally at least one ShippingServiceOptions container will be required.
<br><br>
If you specify multiple <b>ShippingServiceOptions</b> nodes, the repeating nodes must b
contiguous. For example, you can insert <b>InternationalShippingServiceOption</b> nodes
after a list of repeating <b>ShippingServiceOptions</b> nodes, but not between them:
<br><br>
<code>
&lt;ShippingServiceOptions&gt;...&lt;/ShippingServiceOptions&gt;<br>
&lt;ShippingServiceOptions&gt;...&lt;/ShippingServiceOptions&gt;<br>
&lt;ShippingServiceOptions&gt;...&lt;/ShippingServiceOptions&gt;<br>
&lt;InternationalShippingServiceOption&gt;...&lt;/InternationalShippingServiceOption&gt
&lt;InternationalShippingServiceOption&gt;...&lt;/InternationalShippingServiceOption&gt
</code>
<br><br>
If you specify <b>ShippingDetails</b> when you revise or relist an item but you omit
<b>ShippingServiceOptions</b>, eBay will drop the domestic shipping services from the
listing. This may also have unintended side effects, as other fields that depend
on this data may be dropped as well.
<br/><br/>
To retain the shipping services and
dependent fields when you modify other shipping details, it may be simplest to
specify all <b>ShippingDetails</b> that you still want to include in the listing.
<br><br>
A seller can offer up to four domestic shipping services and up to five
international shipping services. However, if the seller is opted in to the Global Shipp
shipping services must be the same shipping type (for example, Flat versus
Calculated).

This container is used to reference and apply a seller's domestic and/or international shipping rate tables to a listing. Shipping rate tables allow sellers to
configure specific shipping costs based on the shipping destinations and level of service (e.g. economy, standard, expedited, and one-day). Generally speaking,
sellers want to use these shipping rate tables so they can charge a higher shipping cost to the buyer whenever shipping costs are higher for them as well. For
example, shipping to Alaska or Hawaii is generally more expensive than shipping to any other of the 48 US states, or in regards to international shipping,
shipping to some regions and countries are more expensive than others.

In a fixed-priced listing, a seller can offer variations of the same item.
For example, the seller could create a fixed-priced listing for a t-shirt
design, and offer the shirt in different colors and sizes. In this case, each
color and size combination is a separate variation. Each variation can have
a different quantity and price. Due to the possible price differentiation,
buyers can buy multiple items from this listing at the same time, but all of
the items must be of the same variation. One order line item is created
whether one or multiple quanity of the same variation are purchased.

was purchased. Therefore, applications that process orders

Since a bidder's user info is anonymous, this tag contains the actual
value of an ID only for that bidder, and for the seller of an item that the user i
bidding on. For other users, the actual value is replaced by an
anonymous value, according to these rules:
<br><br>
When bidding on items, <b>UserID</b> is replaced with the
value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from the <b>UserID</b>. For
example, if the <b>UserID</b> = <code>IBidALot</code>, it might be displayed as, "
<br/><br/>
<span class="tablenote"><b>Important: </b>
In this format, the anonymous bidder ID can change for each
auction.
</span>
For <b>GetMyeBayBuying</b> only, when bidding on items: <b>UserID</b>
is replaced with the value "a****b" where a and b are random characters from
the <b>UserID</b>.
<br><br>
When bidding on items listed on the Philippines site: <b>UserID</b> is replaced
with the value "Bidder X" where X is a number indicating the order of that
user's first bid. For example, if the user was the third bidder,
<b>UserID</b> = <code>Bidder 3</code>.
Note that in this Philippines site format, the anonymous bidder ID stays the same
auction, but is different for different auctions. For example, a bidder who
is the third and then the seventh bidder in an auction will be listed for
both bids as "Bidder 3". However, if that same bidder is the first bidder on
a different auction, the bidder will be listed for that auction as "Bidder
1", not "Bidder 3".
<br><br>
For <b>GetMyeBayBuying</b> only, when bidding on items listed on the UK and AU sit
<b>UserID</b> is replaced with the string "High Bidder".

This type defines the VariationProductListingDetails container that is used to specify a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), such as an EAN, an ISBN, or a
UPC value, to identify a specific product variation in a multiple-variation listing. For a multiple-variation listing, the same GTIN type(s) must be used for all
product variations within the same listing. For instance, if specify an ISBN value for one product variation within the listing, an ISBN value (and not an EAN
or UPC value) must be specified for all product variations within the listing.
This field is used if the seller wants to, or is required to identify each product variation within a multiplge-variation listing by an ISBN (International
Standard Book Number) value. An ISBN is a unique identifer for books. Both 10 and 13-character ISBNs are supported. When specifying a 13-character
ISBN, the value must begin with either '978' or '979'. The seller can use the GetCategoryFeatures call to see if an ISBN is supported/required for a category.

Currently, sellers cannot associate an eBay catalog product with single variations within a multiple-variation listing for any eBay category. If the seller
attempts to supply an eBay Product Identifier (ePID) at the variation level, a warning will get returned in the response stating that, 'Specifying a product
identifier on a variant is not allowed in this category.'.
The ProductReferenceID field was originally added as part of the Product-Based Shopping Experience (PBSE) mandate, and eBay was going to allow and
even require ePIDs to be specified for some leaf categories. However, with the rollback of the PBSE mandate, this field is not currently applicable or
supported.

Multi-variation listings contain items that are logically the same
product, but that vary in their manufacturing details or packaging.
For example, a particular brand and style of shirt could be
available in different sizes and colors, such as "large blue" and
"medium black" variations.
Variations are multiple similar (but not identical) items in a
fixed-price listing.
For example, a single listing could contain multiple items of the
same brand and model that vary by color and size (like "Blue, Large" and "Black, Medium"). Each va

APIs, or application programming interfaces, at eBay are the front door to our global marketplace platform. They enable our business to expand into new
contexts, allowing third-party platforms to extend their value proposition while also bringing their customers to us.
With the eBay Developers Program's latest APIs for selling and buying, eBay is providing its developers with powerful technology and features that benefit
both buyers and sellers, such as:
eBay's Buy APIs that enable developers to build buying experiences where consumers can purchase products from eBay anytime, anywhere—wherever
consumers are online.
Next Generation Sell APIs that provide a generational technology improvement over our earlier Trading API.
APIs that are designed and based on use cases that we have carefully vetted with buyers, sellers, and solution providers.
eBay Developers Program portal and tools that are continually expanding to support the next generation of APIs.

listing or access to My eBay), you may provide this access only after “
Authentication
.” Authentication occurs when an eBay User grants your Application access to their eBay Content via an eBay-controlled sign-in and consent page. An “
Authenticated User
” is an eBay User who has granted such access to your Application. You represent, warrant and covenant that Your Users may revoke Authentication at
any time for any reason.
Public Display.
To the extent eBay Content is publicly available within an eBay Service, you may display such eBay Content within your Application to promote eBay and
enable Your Users to search and browse listings (“
Public Display
”), subject to the following restrictions: (1) When the eBay Content is no longer publicly available, you must delete it from your Application. For example,
when an eBay User ID is publicly available in connection with a listing on the eBay Site, you may display the eBay User ID through your Application; but if
that eBay User ID is no longer viewable in connection with the listing or is otherwise anonymized, you may no longer display the eBay User ID in a Public
Display; (2) eBay Content in a Public Display may not be co-mingled or combined with non-eBay Content. For example, all eBay Content in a Public Display
must be visually isolated from third-party listings or other non-eBay information; and (3) eBay Content that is available only to an eBay User after signing
in to the eBay User’s account may only be displayed to that eBay User and only after Authentication, and such eBay Content may not be used for Public
Display without the explicit prior consent of that Authenticated User.
Age of Displayed eBay Content.
eBay Content displayed within your Application must be kept reasonably up to date. Displayed item listing information may not be more than six (6) hours
older than information displayed on the eBay Site, and other eBay Content must be no more than twenty-four (24) hours older than content displayed on
the eBay Site. If your displayed item listing is not as current as the listing on the eBay Site, you will disclose in your Application how much older your
displayed item listing is than the same listing on the eBay Site.
Prohibited Use and Derivation of Information.
You must have eBay’s express prior written permission to use or display eBay Content in any way that enables derivation of, including without limitation,
any of the following:
Any site-wide statistics across eBay Sites or within any eBay Site;
Take-up rates for enhanced listings (for example, gallery, featured, category featured,
etc.
);
Statistics relating to the performance (financial or otherwise) of any eBay Service (for example, gross merchandise sales);
Average selling price or gross merchandise sold for any eBay category.
Notwithstanding Your Users’ access to and use of their own information, you must have eBay’s express prior written permission to use or display eBay
Content in any way that enables derivation of, including without limitation, any of the following:
Aggregated seller or buyer data (for example, Personal Information);
Data relating to the performance of sellers, either individually or in aggregate (for example, performance data related to promotional campaigns, ad
placements, or promoted listings);
Aggregated data relating to transactions conducted through third-party affiliates (for example, off-eBay purchases on social networks, merchants, or other
marketplaces enabled through Buy APIs);
Data comparing eBay User utilization of eBay Services and the services of any third party;
Information relating to specific eBay Users or types of eBay Users;
Conversion, completion or success rates; or
Reserve auction information.

with Your Users, or send communications initiated by and on behalf of Your Users to Other Users, to promote and facilitate access to and use of eBay

Requirements and Limitations on Use of Restricted APIs.
Some of eBay’s Restricted APIs use artificial intelligence to provide outputs (“AI Outputs”), including original content. AI Outputs may not always be
accurate, complete, or unique. You must independently verify AI Outputs and will be solely responsible for any AI Outputs that you, or your users, use,
generate, or share. You agree that eBay retains the right to generate the same or similar AI Outputs for others.
With respect to Restricted APIs, Developer may not:
Ingest or otherwise incorporate information from Restricted APIs, including AI Outputs, into any artificial intelligence model, system, or tool (“AI”) that is
not provided by or licensed from eBay without eBay’s prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld in eBay’s sole discretion;
Use the Restricted APIs to develop, train, or improve algorithms or AI that would be reasonably likely to benefit third parties other than consumer users of
any Developer’s tool;
Sell, share, assign, or otherwise transfer, or license or sublicense (through multiple tiers), as applicable, the information from Restricted APIs to any third
party who is not a mutual customer of you and eBay (for example, an eBay seller);
Electronically distribute via API the Restricted APIs data (either in raw or aggregated form) or allow the Restricted APIs data (either in raw or aggregated
form) to be downloaded in bulk.
Developer is permitted to use, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display and host, and distribute data outputs of the Restricted APIs Data during
the Term to develop pricing tools, only upon receiving eBay’s express prior written consent. In the event that eBay provides such consent, any internal or
external pricing tools created by Developer that incorporate data from or are enhanced by the Restricted APIs data (“eBay Enhanced Tools”), Developer
agrees to the following:
Developer grants to eBay and its affiliates a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, irrevocable, worldwide, license to access, run, publicly
display, perform, redistribute, reproduce, modify, host, translate, store and other use use the eBay Enhanced Tools.

including social media marketing and any and all other methods to attract users to eBay and its affiliates’ sites to the attention of users;
Use the eBay Enhanced Tools and/or their data outputs and any excerpts thereof; and
Modify, enhance, and create derivative works of the eBay Enhanced Tools data outputs through integration witheBay’s pricing tools.
Provided, that in each case of the foregoing, eBay and its affiliates shall use the eBay Enhanced Tools data outputs for the benefit of eBay and its affiliates
and their respective customers.
Developer represents and warrants that the eBay Enhanced Tools shall comply with applicable law, including without limitation complying with the FTC
regulatory requirements on deceptive pricing; and that to the extent Developer uses scraped data in its pricing tools, Developer confirms that it has not
and will not circumvent any third-party rights, and that the eBay Enhanced Tools will not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the rights of any
third party.
Section 8.5 does not obligate eBay to utilize the eBay Enhanced Tools or their data outputs on the eBay Site or its affiliates’ Sites. Further, nothing in this
Agreement shall preclude eBay from developing itself, having developed or developing for others, any product, tool or data set that is competitive with the
eBay Enhanced Tools or their data outputs provided that the technology does not incorporate and is not derived from or based on any of Developer’s
Confidential Information; eBay shall not be deemed to be in breach of the foregoing solely on account of using or incorporating technology, information,
materials, or other intellectual property (collectively, “Similar IP”) that is similar or materially equivalent to Developer’s Confidential Information, or any
portion thereof, so long as such Similar IP was not obtained (directly or indirectly from Developer. For the avoidance of doubt, Developer’s Confidential
Information shall not include the eBay Enhanced Tools or their data outputs.

SCOPE
Relationship of the Parties.
The parties acknowledge and agree in connection with the processing of Personal Data for the eBay Services, each party (a) is an independent controller
of the Personal Data under Data Protection Laws; (b) will individually determine the purposes and means of its processing of Personal Data; and (c) will
comply with the obligations applicable to it under Data Protection Laws with respect to Personal Data.
Purpose of Processing.
Developer may receive Personal Data in connection with its use of the eBay Services (“eBay Services Data”). The Parties acknowledge and agree that
Developer may process the eBay Services Data only for the purposes specified in the Agreement. Any processing outside of these explicitly stated
purposes is strictly prohibited. Subject to the foregoing, each party remains independently responsible for establishing its own legal basis for the
processing of the eBay Services Data to the extent required by Data Privacy Laws.
Security.
Developer shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that meet or exceed industry standards to protect the Personal Data (i) from
accidental or unlawful destruction, and (ii) loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to the Personal Data (a "Security Incident"). Such
appropriate technical and organizational measures shall include at a minimum the measures described herein as Annex II.
Audit Rights.
eBay reserves the right to conduct periodic audits of Developer's security measures and practices related to the protection of Personal Data. Developer
agrees to fully cooperate with such audits and provide all necessary information and access.
TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA
General Obligations for Transfer of Data.
Either Party may transfer Personal Data to third countries if such transfer complies with the provisions for the transfer of such data as set forth in
applicable Data Privacy Laws. To the extent applicable, Developer represents that they are able to act as an exporting controller of data whether by their
organization being within the applicable jurisdiction (e.g., European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, as applicable) or by being subject to
categorization under Clause 13(a) of the SCCs as an organization capable of acting as an exporter from the European Union or equivalent provision under
the UK GDPR or the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection.
Transfers of European Union/United Kingdom/Switzerland Personal Data to Developer.
To the extent that EBAY transfers Personal Data requiring a legal data transfer mechanism to Developer and Developer is established in a country outside
of the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland (as applicable) that is not subject to an adequacy decision in the applicable jurisdiction, then
Developer will be deemed to have entered into the required SCCs as the data importer with the relevant EBAY party identified in
Annex III
as the data exporter, and such transfers will be subject to those SCCs.
Transfers of European Union/United Kingdom/Switzerland Personal Data to EBAY.
To the extent that Developer transfers Personal Data requiring a legal data transfer mechanism to EBAY, then Developer will be deemed to have entered
into the required SCCs as the data exporter with the relevant EBAY Party identified in
Annex III
as the data importer, and such transfers will be subject to those SCCs.
Transfers of Brazilian Personal Data.
To the extent that a party transfers personal data subject to the LGPD to the other party, then the transferring party will be deemed to have entered into the
required SCCs as the data exporter with the receiving party as the data importer, and such transfers will be subject to those SCCs. With respect to EBAY,
such SCCs shall be deemed to be entered into by the relevant EBAY Party identified in
Annex III
.
Transfers of Swiss Personal Data.
To the extent that a party transfers personal data subject to the Switzerland Data Protection Law, the 2021 Standard Contractual Clauses form part of this
DPA and take precedence over the rest of this DPA for such transfer to the extent of any conflict.
Transfers of Personal Data from Argentina to outside of Argentina.
To the extent that provision of the eBay Services involves the transfer of personal data from Argentina to outside of Argentina (either directly or via onward
transfer) to a jurisdiction that does not have adequate legislation in the terms of article 12 of Law No. 25,326 and its regulatory Decree No. 1558/01, then the
parties will be deemed to have entered into the required Argentinian Model Clauses, and such transfers will be subject to those Model Clauses. The roles
of the parties and the description of transfers, for the purposes of Annex A to the Argentinian Model Clauses, is set out in
Appendix A hereto
.
United States Regulations 28 CFR Part 202.

restrictions or provisions applicable to eBay Personal Data. Developer agrees to certify periodically to eBay, at intervals determined by eBay, in writing,
Developer’s compliance with 28 CFR Part 202. Developer agrees to not evade or avoid, cause a violation of, or attempt to violate any of the prohibitions set
forth in Executive Order 14117 or 28 CFR Part 202. Any breach of 28 CFR Part 202 or Executive Order 14117 will constitute a material breach of the
Agreement and this DPA, entitling eBay to immediately terminate the Agreement and seek all available remedies.
Use and Transfer Restrictions.
eBay grants Developer with a non-transferable, revocable license to access the eBay Services Data and any data derived from it. Developer is prohibited
from engaging or attempting to engage in, or permitting others to engage or attempt to engage in further “covered data transactions,” as defined in 28 CFR
Part 202, including, but not limited to, the following:
Selling, licensing of access to, or other similar commercial transactions, such as reselling, sub-licensing, leasing, or transferring in return for valuable
consideration, the eBay Services Data or any part thereof, to “countries of concern” or “covered persons,” as defined in 28 CFR Part 202;
Sharing, granting access to, transmitting, or making eBay Services Data available to any “covered person” under any employment or investment
agreement, as those terms are defined in 28 CFR Part 202.
Reporting Obligations.
In the event that Developer becomes aware or suspects that a “country of concern” or “covered person” has gained access to eBay Services Data through
a data brokerage transaction, Developer will immediately notify eBay. Failure to comply with the above provisions will constitute a breach of contract and
may also constitute a violation of 28 CFR Part 202, and eBay shall have the right to terminate the Agreement and this DPA and demand an immediate return
or deletion of eBay Services Data.
For Covered Persons
.
To the extent that Developer is a covered person as defined in 28 CFR Part 202, sections 3(g)(1-3) above shall not apply; however, such Developer

Developer agrees that this DPA does not enlarge any rights or restrict any obligations provided for in the Agreement, and Developer continues to be
limited to the data use rights and restrictions provided for therein.
Limitations of Liability.
This DPA in no way alters the limitations of liability or other legal terms set out in the Agreement.
Governing Law.
This DPA shall be governed by the laws of the applicable jurisdiction in accordance with the definition of SCCs within Section 1.i of the DPA herein or as
otherwise set forth under applicable Data Protection Laws. In all other cases, this DPA shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction stated in the
